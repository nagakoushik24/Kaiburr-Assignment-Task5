"Credit reporting, repair, or other",These are not my accounts.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I wrote three requests, the unverified accounts listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. Equifax is under FCRA law to obtain the of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. I have already filed a FTC Report and Police Report. Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA. Please remove the following accounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX"
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I paid off my Synchrony Lowes account. After this account was paid, Synchrony added a couple dollars of interest. I was not made aware of a new charge, and the card ended up getting late payments. Once I was made aware, I immediately paid the account off, again. Now Synchrony is refusing to remove the late payments, despite adding interest to the account after I paid it full. I later received a notice from Synchrony stating that they have to report accurately but never acknowledged that interest was charged after the account was paid off. They are using unethical practices and are taking advantage of me and it is extremely frustrating. These late payments should not be there!"

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file.

Debt collection,"SPS Select Portfolio Servicing of XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT appears to be a debt collection agency, who started a systematic harassment by mail debt collection campaign against wife, XXXX XXXX. 

This harassment following a failed foreclosure attempt over the past 2 years ( XXXX-XXXX ) by XXXX XXXX XXXX and their attorneys ( XXXX ) over a 2nd Mortgage default loan by XXXX, approximately 10 Years ago. 

During XXXX-XXXX time period of XXXX/XXXX ( attempt to foreclose on our residence, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, VA XXXX, on legal advice & assistance of Mr. XXXX XXXX, Attorney, XXXX XXXX, VA, both myself, XXXX XXXX, and wife, XXXX, entered Chapter XXXX Trustee Protection, twice, that prevented the foreclosure attempt by XXXX/XXXX legal agent."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I when to pull out my credit report last year and I found out that I have three account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which those are not my debt and start sending letter to collection agency and never get any answer  back from them. 
I also contacted Equifax+XXXX XXXX+ XXXX and no answer, trying to resolve this matter but no help from those Credit reporting agency"
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a personal loan from the XXXX XXXX, XXXX branch of XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy which included that loan. The bankruptcy was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, and the loan is being properly listed on my credit report as Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. 

However there is another loan listed on my credit report under Mariner Finance. It was also reportedly issued on XX/XX/XXXX, with a last payment made date of XX/XX/XXXX, the exact dates reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX. This loan is being reported as Unpaid Balance Charged Off. I have never applied for or received a loan from Mariner Finance, and certainly did not apply for or receive two entirely different loans on XX/XX/XXXX, as is currently claimed on my credit report. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX merged with Mariner Finance , LLC and on XX/XX/XXXX, the company became known as Mariner Finance. It appears that sometime between the merger and the final discharge of the debt, the account was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Mariner Finance, resulting in a new account number. That doesn't make it a new loan or change the fact it was XXXX, however. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an online dispute with XXXX, identifying the duplication and noting this was likely the same loan reported twice. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply claiming the accounts were verified as accurate. I'm not sure how it was verified, but someone, somewhere, is mistaken. 

I contacted the main office of Mariner Finance on XX/XX/XXXX, to correct this error. I spoke with XXXX and explained the problem, and was transferred to XXXX at the XXXX XXXX, XXXX branch. After I explained again, XXXX told me that her manager, XXXX, was out of the office but would return my call the following day. On the XXXX, my wife spoke with XXXX, and explained the situation yet again. He stated repeatedly there was nothing he could do and claimed if XXXX was saying it was verified, then it must be accurate. He suggested we contact an attorney if we had further questions. 

I am trying very hard to make sure my credit report is accurate and have hit a brick wall here. On XX/XX/XXXX, after my wife spoke with XXXX, I contacted XXXX by phone to dispute their results and still have not received any indication that they are doing anything to correct this problem."
Mortgage,"Rushmore Loan management XXXX will not permit applying for loan modification online and direct you to call. However, they do not answer the phone and the phone directs you to go online. 

I have spent hours trying to reach this company to no avail. Many times they tell you to call back during business hours but it is during business hours. 
Rushmore recently bought my loan from XXXX and they are a sham! 

They need to be required to staff appropriately to meet the needs of their customers during this critical time. 

It is unacceptable to just ignore refinancing, loan modification and other needs of customers."

Debt collection,i have gone 5 moths to resolve this confusion with the credit bureaus and with the company itself and o have had no luck. they do not respond with validation to verify this is mine and therefore they havent deleted it either. i have read up on the fcra and also the fdcpa and my rights have been violated as per them. so i need this to be removed and i need your help to solve this please as i read also about your company that you help us out as consumers and i need help. the name of the company is citi bank. for the XXXX amount of like XXXX XXXX dollars.
Debt collection,I have already had to file a complaint against diversified adjustment service with the BBB because they were threatening my credit report and refused to allow me to dispute a debt they keep calling me over. I advised them I am disputing the debt and they will not allow me to do so. Now they constantly call my phone to harass me. I have told them 4xs now to stop calling my phone and they will not. This is harassment and I want it to stop. I just called XXXX XXXX today and advised XXXX the third party they sent information to is harassing me and I want it to stop as I have been making monthly payments to XXXX XXXX for a past due balance. XXXX XXXX  gets $ XXXX as we originally agreed to before they placed my account in collections and I am now being harassed and it is against the FDCPA to continue to call and harass a consumer after they are told to stop and after I advised them I am disputing the debt. They are to not call me for 30 days while they investigate the dispute in which they have failed to do. I want a validation and verification of debt from Diversified Adjustment and I want them to stop harassing me. I have already asked 4xs to stop.
Debt collection,"I want to stress that I did not give written permission for these specific transactions to be included in my consumer report. At no point did I authorize these entries, and their presence on my report is unwarranted. Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity. I trust that you will handle this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Please confirm the removal of these transactions from my report as soon as possible. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue."

They have sent me 4 new cards and it hasn't done any good. I WANT THIS TO STOP. I'm going to pay this account off and never use this account again. I shouldn't have to do this."
Debt collection,"I previously requested full validation of this alleged debt, including : A signed copy of the original creditor agreement, A complete accounting and itemization of the balance, and Proof of legal assignment/ownership. 

What I received instead were generic verification sheets and recycled data that fail to meet the requirements of the FDCPA 809 ( b ). These do not constitute proper validation.

By continuing to report unverifiable or incomplete information, this company is in violation of the FCRA 623. A sellers summary or computer printout is not legal validation.

I am demanding deletion of this tradeline from all credit reporting agencies. If the company continues to furnish unverifiable information, I will pursue federal legal remedies for damages, costs, and attorney fees. 

This is the final notice.

Mortgage,"This complaint is for TCF, Identical complaint filed for XXXX XXXX XXXX There are two lenders involved in my complaint. I had a HELOC loan with TCF bank that sold my loan to XXXX XXXX  XXXX  back in XXXX of this year. This loan was actually converted to a long term loan many months earlier and we no longer have the ability to draw on that loan according to our agreement. Before even making our first payment with our new loan servicer they reached out to us looking for the first payment in XXXX. I explained XXXX 's payment was made with the first loan servicer and we have sent them proof of that payment. Each month we pay the same amount to them as we did our previous loan despite requests for different payment amounts each month, asking for mostly smaller amounts. We have made several attempts to provide XXXX  with documentation that this payment was made and that we were current as of the date of the loan being sold. The original servicer has provided us with the documentation but is unwilling to contact the second directly each time telling us they can't contact them anymore and to give them a new document proving we have paid. Each time I call the new servicer they humiliate me reminding me I am late and this is an attempt to collect a debt. One lender selling a loan to the next shouldn't be my problem to fix as the problem was created in the sale of the loan. I feel I'm running out of options but certainly don't want to pay another payment to them that we don't owe them. This practice can't be acceptable and I'm asking for help."

Mortgage,"I currently have my mortgage with GMFS, serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have had continuous problems over the past several months. On XX/XX/2020 I inquired through their web portal about any assistance being offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. I received a response back on XX/XX/2020 advising me of the terms and conditions of a forbearance program and that my account may be eligible. After reviewing the terms and conditions I responded back via the web portal on XX/XX/2020 advising I would not be interested in taking advantage of the forbearance. On XX/XX/2020 I received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX advising a request had been put in to stop the forbearance. 
I made my payment as scheduled for XXXX ; however, I received a robocall within a couple of days advising my forbearance had been approved. I signed on and noticed the payment I made did not apply towards my monthly payments ; however, to unidentified funds. I sent yet another response on XX/XX/2020 advising them I declined the forbearance and I would like my payment corrected. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a response back stating the cancellation was put in on XX/XX/XXXX for forbearance and that my payment would be applied correctly. Keep in mind, I never authorized this forbearance. At this point I assumed all would be well. The exact same thing happened for XXXX and XXXX. After speaking with a supervisor ( I do not remember the date ) I was advised my account did go through the full three months of forbearance ; however, all payments were posted accordingly. I did have to write in and/or call every month to have my payments corrected. It got so bad that I had one associate tell me over the phone that I had only made a partial payment. All of this was eventually straightened out. After all this is said and done, I now have a forbearance on my record with this company and that is not fair. I specifically said I do not want it. Also, I have tried to set up ACH for the past two months. To this day, I keep getting denial letters for ACH because my account is in "" Forbearance ''. Once again, this is unfair, as I now don't have something available to me that other customers have available to them, especially when the account should have never been in forbearance. I have spoken with two associates regarding this and they could not give me a reason as to why the ACH is getting kicked back for forbearance. The management team does not make themselves readily available for escalated situations rather you have to wait on them to call you whenever they have free time. 
I feel as though I am stuck. I can not easily go out and refinance my house as that usually cost a nice chunk of money out of pocket ; therefore, I have to be subjected to the poor service and having things on my record I didn't ask for."

Mortgage,"After being approved for, and receiving a payment supplement from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ), due to being behind on payments on an FHA-insured mortgage, I decided to sell my property. During the process, I learned that I needed to request a payoff statement from HUD, because those loans needed to be paid back upon selling. I requested and received that information with no problem. 

Upon receipt, I learned that two of my three loans could be paid directly to HUD, but the most recent payment supplement amount owed has to be determined by the mortgage company, XXXX ( Land Home Financial Services. After nearly 15 calls, speaking to multiple departments, and emailing a department ( Research Dept ) that no one can call, my request has yet to be satisfied. The property was officially sold on XX/XX/year>, and funds are still being held by the title company. Land Home Financial Services has not been able to produce a statement and has not yet returned the funds to HUD, even after I signed a document to voluntarily terminate them. 

I am requesting a payoff statement for these funds. The total amount of the loan was {$11000.00}. From that total, {$5100.00} was applied to a previous balance. The remaining {$6100.00} should have been placed into a Payment Supplement Account, managed by my mortgage servicer, which is what the loan documentation states. Those funds should have been disbursed monthly over the next 36 months. I sold the property after only utilizing those funds for 4 months. 

XXXX in the Loss Mitigation department advised me in XXXX that there was XXXX in the Payment Supplement account. Those funds should have been, or should be returned to HUD because I voluntarily terminated them, and confirmed receipt of that document. I was advised to email the Research department for the request of the statement, and I did so on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ), I have yet to receive an email back. I spoke with XXXX in Customer Service and with a supervisor named XXXX XX/XX/year>, who explained that she was escalating my issue to management. I was advised that I would receive a call within 24-48 hours. My call has not been returned.

I was told that my account would be placed in Forbearance/Deferment while I gathered the appropriate documentation from my employer and concerning my income to be considered for the Income Driven Repayment Plan and Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness. I had the documentation completed by my employer and sent to the provided agency. I thought everything was taken care of and my payment would be $XXXX. In late XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification that I had a monthly bill of over $1000 due to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I called as soon as possible and that was on XX/XX/XXXX. In that phone conversation, I was told it was an error and that my records showed that I should of been placed in Forbearance and/or Deferment and that they would prompt the appropriate paperwork (again) which would automatically place me in either forbearance or deferment for them to be able to review the paperwork. At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX I found that I had been reported by XXXX for being 90 days delinquent. I immediately called XXXX XXXX, was told again it was an error on their part and that they would remedy the situation which would be changed by the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. I was in the middle of obtaining a loan to make repairs to a home that I bought and my credit score dropped by almost 120 points. XX/XX/XXXX came and they still hadn't corrected the error. Several months later, they changed the status of my loan to no longer delinquent but despite multiple calls and disputes, they have continue to report that I was 90 days delinquent in XX/XX/2018. I have attached the letter another complaint that I have made to XXXX XXXX, my phone records showing the calls that I made to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX (I have more but printer ink is limited), an email from XXXX confirming my contact with the company on XX/XX/2018, the results of my credit disputes where XXXX XXXX confirms that my payments were on-time in XX/XX/2018, XX/XX/2018, XX/XX/2018 but somehow 90 days delinquent in XX/XX/2018, print outs from my XXXX XXXX Account that show that I have 0 days delinquent and a letter from them stating that I have 0 days delinquent. It has been almost a year and XXXX XXXX has still not removed this from my credit reporting and despite significant efforts on my part to repair my credit, I have still been able to gain only 20-30 points after loosing almost 120 points to their error. I have seen that they have been sued for these same errors and have been found to do this to consumers repeatedly who have also made multiple complaints with the same exact experience. I do not understand if it takes just a simple click of a button for them to ruin a person's financial health and so many opportunities, why it is so difficult for them to fix these errors. I really, really need help. I cannot wait another 6 years to be able to provide a home to my children or refinance the high interest loans that I have been forced to resort to due to how the ""90 Days Delinquent in XX/XX/2018"" on 3 to 5 student loans (depending on the credit agency) effects my credit score."

Debt collection,Your agency placed an unauthorized collection on my credit file without required notice. I dispute this debt and demand immediate validation as required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). You must cease all collection activity until you provide complete validation.
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/year> I exercised my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g by requesting proper validation of this alleged debt from pro collect. They have had more than a year to respond. 
The only documentation they provided was an internal receipt generated by the apartment complex for work performed by its own maintenance crew. This does not constitute adequate validation, nor does it demonstrate the accuracy of or legal enforceability of the charges. No independent invoices, receipts for actual costs, photos of alleged damage, or lease provisions authorizing such charges have been provided. 
Reporting a debt without proper validation violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681i, which requires that all information furnished to consumer reporting agencies be accurate and verifiable. 
I sent a follow up letter on XX/XX/year>, to which I got no response. I sent a second follow up email XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. To which they just resent the same information they provided a year ago. I wasn't made aware of any money owed to the apartment complex until it was already on my credit."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/19, I e-signed an Intent to Proceed notice with TD Bank for a mortgage loan. The closing date for this transaction was scheduled for XX/XX/19. My attempts to communicate with the loan officer and loan processor since signing the Intent to Proceed have been largely unsuccessful resulting in missed deadlines and a failure to meet the original closing date. Between XX/XX/19 and XX/XX/19, I sent 6 emails to my loan officer and/or loan processor and not a single one was replied to. Over the same approximate 1-month period, I left 11 voicemail phone messages ( no phone calls were ever answered immediately ). Only three of my calls were returned. I received a conditional approval on XX/XX/19 from the lender. I submitted the required documentation to the best of my ability with minimal to no guidance provided by the lender. Due to lender 's failure to respond to my attempted outreach, at no time was I aware if the submitted documentation would be acceptable. 

The conditional loan approval correctly stated the closing date XX/XX/19. An initial closing disclosure is required by XX/XX/19 in order to close by XX/XX/19. TD Bank did not meet the XX/XX/19 deadline for the closing disclosure. I was informed via email onXX/XX/19( the first email response I received since XX/XX/19 ) that the lender has not performed an employment verification. I was informed by TD Bank that a written verification request was sent to my employer on XX/XX/19, the day the closing disclosure was due. During one of the few successful phone calls on XX/XX/19, I asked the loan processor if any documentation was needed for employment verification. I was informed TD Bank would independently obtain the verification. As of XX/XX/19, to my knowledge the only item which is required to complete underwriting is the written employment verification. However, I can not confirm this is the only requirement for underwriting due to the lack of communication. As of the filing of this complaint, I have not received the completed appraisal, the initial closing disclosure, or even a proposed revised closing date. 

TD Bank has failed to display any good-faith efforts indicating that they attempted to close this loan on-time. Outreaches to the TD Bank loan officer and processor have been almost nonexistent. Outreach to TD Banks customer service line has been successful, however, the amount of assistance they can provide me in limited to what is recorded in the system by the loan officer or processor. As a result of the failure to meet the disclosure deadlines and closing date, I now face potential consequences of monetary damages and a cancellation of sale through no fault of my own."
Mortgage,"I am writing about Specialized Loan Servicing ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CO XXXX XXXX www.sls.net ). Unfortunately, my mortgage was sold to them from XXXX XXXX. They are very difficult to work with, they commit acts of fraud, and they do not answer their phones. 

I changed my automatic payment to a new bank toward teh end of XXXX. The website said it would be effective one month later or XX/XX/XXXX. Since the auto payment would not draw process for a month, to ensure I was not in default I made a one time payment. They then auto-drafted a payment for XX/XX/XXXX which was told by their website would not happen for another month later. I now paid my mortgage payment twice in a month causing me extreme financial hardship. I contacted them and actually got a representative. They said they would put through a credit. I never got a credit on my checking account but now they show a credit on my mortgage balance. They have stolen {$1300.00} from me. I tried to contact them and I continually get through the several minutes of "" account authentication '' to be disconnected. This mortgage servicing company MUST be investigated for fraud."

On XX/XX/XXXX, my families home was completely destroyed in a fire, unrelated to a Federal Declaration. Upon inspection we were informed that the home would take upwards of a year to be rebuilt and due to misinformation given by XXXX  insurance department we found out that we lacked homeowners insurance and are responsible for paying for the rebuild out of pocket. We immediately contacted XXXX  and requested information on assistance or options to avoid losing our home and were directed to apply to loss mitigation. We submitted the application and documentation due to the extreme hardship and additional costs related to rebuilding our home, paying for temporary housing in the interim and replacing everything in the interim. We were approved for a special forbearance plan effective XX/XX/XXXX that suspended all payments for 7 months and were directed that if more time were needed to submit a letter with the request. Prior to and after the approval we were asking XXXX  staff how the loan would be reported if we were approved for a loss mitigation plan and were told that XXXX  would report that we were in a payment plan due to a disaster, but once the plan was in place XXXX  has only been reporting that we are in default and not that there is a approved payment plan in place and agreed to due to the disaster we experienced. As its being reported presently, it looks as if we are simple not paying our mortgage.

Mortgage,"I started investigating my mortgage in XXXX, by XX/XX/XXXX I suspected that this was a fraudulent transaction and started by sending refuse for cause without dishonor their requests for payment and inquiring about the details of this particular transaction. I was met with my questions being avoided and lack of meaningful response every time. It didn't appear that GAAP accounting was adhered to, and I suspected the accounting to be falsified. I later discovered that my Note funded the transaction and I wasn't given full disclosure. After trying to get answers that were never answered, I was met with a lawsuit from the opposing party 's debt collection attorneys at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who I believe is guilty of identity theft by using my private data and placing on the public record for unjust enrichment without having standing to do so and who had Never after multiple requests proved their authority to do what they've done. I submitted a complaint to the CFPB back in XXXX and I didn't receive a valid response to my complaint. All the company did was avoid my complaint and say they referred me to their attorneys back in XXXX of XXXX and they followed up my mailing copies of the Deed of Trust and basic mortgage documents that they always send to avoid direct questions. That response is unacceptable. I was never given full disclosure, I do not believe that I ever received a "" loan '' and it is obvious by their silence they have much to hide. Colorado Housing and Finance Authority was given notice by way of Notary presentment of their default and dishonor and opportunity to cure and they were send an affidavit of truth, opportunity to respond and a self executing contract that they agreed to if they refused to respond once again.. That Notice was sent out by registered and certified mail to the master servicer and their sub servicer.

Debt collection,"Misleading information, deceptive lending practices, abuse from management, no phone calls when promised. So much more"
Mortgage,"In XXXX, I owed {$38000.00} on my house when I left chapter XXXX bankruptcy. Under advice of my attorney, I did not reaffirm the loan due to house not being worth the loan value. Over the next couple of years, I tried to negotiate with XXXX  XXXX XXXX to keep my house. I filled out several loan modification applications and submitted them to the bank. In XXXX, I hired an attorney to assist with the loan modification process because of their constantly making me redo the application. That same year XXXX  XXXX XXXX foreclosed on my property and during the foreclosure they transferred the loan to Green Tree Servicing. My attorney submitted the application to Green Tree several times and in XXXX, they denied my application. My attorney advised me that Judge XXXX had setup a portal to monitor the banks handling of the process and I was forced back into bankruptcy. We had to make trial payments before being accepted into the process and on XX/XX/XXXX I signed the modification. 

At this same time The FTC entered into a settlement agreement with Green Tree which was signed on or about XX/XX/XXXX. In this agreement Green Tree entered into settlement in part for Green Trees misrepresentation of inaccurate amounts reported against loans they serviced. On XX/XX/XXXX, Green Tree signed the modification and increased my loan from {$38000.00} to {$59000.00}. 

I have not received any money from the settlement even though servicing of my loan by Green Tree fell within that time period during foreclosure they did not honor the in-process loan modification from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

We continued to struggle, and we had to have the loan modified again. Our loan was now being handled by Ditech and on XX/XX/XXXX the new modified agreement was increased to {$62.00}, XXXX. 

During the whole time we tried to get Green Tree and/or Ditech to explain why this extra money was added to our account. On XX/XX/XXXX of this year, I had to let the house go and I signed a deed in lieu of foreclosure. When I signed the papers, I was upset because I bought this house when I was XXXX years old and lived in for over 30 years.. I asked for copy of notarized paperwork from the notary who told me that he was under orders not to give me a copy. To date, ditech has never sent me a copy. 
In XXXX, Ditech filed foreclosure against me with my loan now being {$68000.00}. I filed a counter claim against Ditech ( see attachments ). On XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from one of Ditechs attorneys that I have no right to sue for Ditech misrepresenting money owed on my loan and/or previous violations of the FTC settlement which they have intentionally ignored and misrepresented amount of my loan plus reported these inaccurate amounts on my credit report. 

In Summary, when I left bankruptcy in XXXX the loan was {$38000.00}. The court would not approve the amount as it was higher than the actual value of {$20.00} - {$25000.00}. Instead Green Tree/ Ditech have used the loan modification process to obtain more than my loan was valued and more than the bankruptcy court would allow to reaffirm the loan. Furthermore, the Hamp program was offered to consumers to save their home which included the following provisions : 1.  Reduce Mortgage Principal 2. Reduce Interest Rate 3. Temporarily postpone or offer forbearance 4. Extend terms of current loan On XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX   made available to consumers principal reduction modification which I would have been eligible for in the second modification but was never offered in my second loan modification. 

Despite knowledge of the requirements imposed through the Consent Order that was settled on XX/XX/XXXX, Green Tree - Ditech have continued to defrauding consumers by : 1. False representation of amount owed on my property through the loan modifications 2. Failure to abide by the order and issue money to me in accordance with the settlement 3. False or inaccurate information being reported on my credit report 4. Not abiding by modification rules to reduce principal Finally they have misrepresented to the bankruptcy court that they are acting in good faith but they are using the court to cause willful and malicious injury to the consumer by not allowing them due process in filing counter claims to preserve their rights to sue for damages arising out of their continued and willful violation of the Consent Order signed with the FTC on XX/XX/XXXX.

My homeowners insurance renewal bill was issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX Mr. Cooper did not issue a check to pay the preium XXXX per their own admission. My premium payment was due XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my premium was 8 days overdue with XXXX and they advised they had not received payment from Mr. Cooper. Therefore, I was forced to pay my homeowners insurance premium in the amount of {$2000.00} in full to avoid my policy being rescinded/cancelled for non-payment of premium. 

I pay into an escrow account and expect my mortgage servicer to promptly pay taxes and insurance bills. Mr. Cooper failed to pay my insurance bill timely, which could have resulted in a significant exposure by having my insurance rescinded, leading to higher premiums with less coverage. I have also had to previously remind them to pay my county tax bill to avoid penalties. Further, Mr. Cooper 's recent data breach has exposed my personal information. Mr. Cooper is failing to promptly service my escrow account and does not appear to be taking appropriate action to protect my interests."

1. Undisclosed or Unauthorized Fees I have been repeatedly charged "" express payment '' fees and other service fees that were not properly disclosed in the terms and conditions of my account. These fees appear to be arbitrarily applied, without my request or authorization for expedited processing.

2. Improper Interest Rate Increases My account reflects an increased interest rate without any formal notice or justification, as required by federal law. I did not receive advance notification, nor was I given the opportunity to opt out. I request all documentation related to these rate changes, including the specific dates and communication records of any notices allegedly sent. 

3. Inaccurate Credit Reporting I have discovered incorrect and damaging information reported by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to the credit reporting agencies, including inaccurate payment histories and balance data.

Their continued collection efforts and potential credit reporting without proper validation constitute willful violations of federal law and cause ongoing harm, including emotional distress, reputational damage, and time lost in defending against an invalid claim."

Debt collection,"Approximately three months ago ( i.e. XX/XX/2019 ) I began receiving SMS text messages suggesting that I had a delinquent loan. The messages were vague, but after receiving several of them, I called the number from which they originated. The person at the other end identified herself as an employee of Golden Valley Lending, and asserted I had taken a {$700.00} loan from the company she represented. I had, until that day, never heard of Golden Valley Lending, and definitely had not taken a {$700.00} loan from anyone. I said as much and, after a short exchange, determined the call was a phishing scam, and hung up. 

Since that time, I have received not less than 8 calls from Golden Valley Lending per week, originating from numerous different phone numbers. The most recent two are : * (  XXXX ) XXXX * ( XXXX ) XXXX I've blacklisted each new number as I've received the calls, which all adhere to the following format ( paraphrased ) : Golden Valley Lending : ""  Is [ My Name ] available '' Me : "" This is [ My Name ] '' GVL : "" This is [ fill in name ] with Golden Valley Lending. We're calling to discuss the status of your account '' Me : "" I do not have an account with you ; I've never opened an account with you. '' GVL : "" That's not what our records show. '' Me : "" I can't account for your records, but we don't have anything to discuss. '' GVL : "" Good luck with that. These calls will continue. '' <call is disconnected> I have repeatedly asked to be removed from their call list, and been denied. I have repeatedly asked for a written record of my debt, and have never seen one.  I have received one printed letter via USPS, again vaguely suggesting I need to address some kind of debt-related issue but without any account number, amount, clear indication that the letter is an attempt to collect a debt, advisory of my rights, etc. It seemed to be merely a form letter that looked like it was designed to get me to call their office. 

I have checked my credit reports with three agencies to confirm no debt has been reported in the amount Golden Valley Lending has asserted. I have received no official attempt to collect a debt, and my credit score remains unblemished even though I've been ignoring these calls, more or less, for months."

The first request was XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. Claim they had sent it to XXXX XXXX a few days after the XX/XX/XXXX day and nothing was ever sent or received. Even when the request was sent on XXXX XXXX, I have never heard of a payoff taking XXXX business days to send. No response. I then called to find out what the issue was that it wasn't send to them. Was told that it would take 5-7 business days because of a discharged bankruptcy due to checking to see if there were any fees involved. Here it is XXXX XXXX and my husband and I are still getting the runaround along with XXXX  XXXX. On my last call on XX/XX/year> spoke with Supervisor named XXXX so he claimed he was, stating we had to take it from the second request of XX/XX/year>. This all appears to us as a stall tactic.

Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. 

It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity.

I am currently not in default, but in imminent default due to a recent job loss. According to HUD guidance, I am eligible for this program without needing to be 60 days late. 

Despite this, XXXX placed me into the XXXX Unemployment Forbearance, a less appropriate option that I did not request. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have : Emailed XXXX multiple times referencing the correct program by name, Participated in face-to-face video appointments, Called their office repeatedly, including direct contact with a supervisor, And submitted two CFPB complaints, which XXXX closed by falsely stating that I was placed in the program I asked for. 

I have clearly and repeatedly asked to be placed in the FHA XXXX Recovery Forbearance, which is designed for borrowers like me in imminent default. Instead, XXXX continues to stall, misstate program guidelines, and apply internal options that are not HUD-compliant. 

Their inaction has now pushed me deeper into financial strain and closer to actual default. I am requesting that XXXX be required to : Immediately remove the incorrect forbearance classification.

Debt collection,"CFPB Complaint False Credit Reporting by Summit AR and XXXX XXXX I am filing this formal complaint against Summit AR ( a collections agency representing XXXXXXXX XXXXr ) and XXXXXXXX XXXX  for unlawfully damaging my credit profile by reporting a debt I do not owe or recognize. This has resulted in derogatory marks on my previously excellent credit history, and I request immediate intervention under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) to delete all negative information from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, with no collection or charge-off remaining, open or active. 

Key Facts of the Dispute : In XXXX, the vehicle in question was rented under XXXX XXXX 's XXXX Plus subscription model ( Subscription ID : XXXX ) a corporate monthly subscription leased exclusively to Debt XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the sole contracting party. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX signed the agreement, assumed full liability, and was covered by the program 's comprehensive insurance, which included protection for any damages ( e.g., the alleged cracked windshield ). 
I, XXXX XXXX, was designated as the driver only for operational purposes and was not a party to the lease or rental agreement ; I bear no personal responsibility or liability. 
Summit AR, acting on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX erroneously placed a derogatory tradeline on my credit reports for this supposed bill, despite the corporate nature of the rental and the absence of any contract assigning personal liability to me. Summit AR falsely alleged that my credit history had been impacted since XXXX. This statement is false since the derogatory mark appeared today XX/XX/XXXX on my credit profile as collection and charge of. 
Despite my repeated demands to both XXXX XXXXr and Summit AR for validation documentation ( e.g., the specific contract excerpt proving individual responsibility ), none has been providedbecause no such provision exists under the corporate subscription agreement of at the time XXXX Plus Subscription Model This inaccurate reporting violates FCRA provisions requiring accurate and verifiable information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) and 1681i ). The debt should have been processed through XXXX XXXX XXXX 's insured corporate account under the subscription rental agreement, not pursued against me individually. 

Requested Actions : Immediately investigate and direct Summit AR and XXXX XXXX to delete the tradeline and all associated derogatory marks from my credit reports at XXXX XXXX and XXXX. 
Ensure no collection, charge-off, or further negative reporting appears on my profile, restoring my excellent credit history immediately. 
Provide written confirmation to me within XXXX  days that : ( a ) the debt has been validated as corporate and rebilled to XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( b ) all collection efforts against me have ceased, and ( c ) the tradeline has been permanently deleted and reported as such to the bureaus. 
If non-compliance persists, pursue enforcement actions against Summit AR and XXXX XXXX for willful violations, including potential statutory damages.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Dear Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. Below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues. 

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18U.S.C. 1621. 

The tradelines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 

In addition, it has also been discovered that these STUDENT LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within my credit file. The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So, these accounts do not belong to me. 
STUDENT LOAN CREDITORS : DPT EDXXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other",Ok this is for TransUnion. I originally challenged these issues with them on XX/XX/21 asking them abut some inconsistent and inaccurate items that they are reporting on my credit profile. I contacted the courts asking them if they shared my info with a credit reporting agency which you will see attached. All they reported back was that it was verified through some company called XXXX. I went to XXXX and explained to them the inaccuracies and they agreed to remove them because they weren't valid. Also attached. Then on XX/XX/21 I sent all of this information to TransUnion to get them to remove the information from my credit report and they still ignored me. They have been completely violating my consumer rights and nobody will do anything about it. They lied about verifying this account to be accurate. And when i called them out on it they still are reporting it.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I purchased two phones from XXXX who is a wholesale retailer for XXXX XXXX. Both phones were returned on XXXX XX/XX/2018 to XXXX and XXXX provided a refund receipt. A refund receipt and credit card refund is attached. The return was within the remorse period by XXXX and honored by XXXX. 

XXXX was not able to communicate the refund to XXXX XXXX  and they called be about the amount due after many months. I told XXXX that the devices were returned and they need to call their retailer. XXXX made no attempt to reach out to XXXX and so I personally went to the store and asked him to resend the cancellation. XXXX provided a copy of refund receipt. 
XXXX then sent the amount to the collection and every time I tell collection agency that it has been returned, they sell it to other collection agencies. 
I reached out to Transunion to correct the reporting but they reach out to XXXX who keeps confirming. Both TUC and XXXX are ignoring refund receipt. 

I have to pay a higher interest rate due to collection and more recently denied credit due to the collection on my report. I have called XXXX but they keep saying that the account is in the collection and they can not open my file. so I am in a vicious loop trying to correct a wrong item on my credit report. 
I want XXXX to call XXXX  ( phone numbers are there in the attached ) and correct the issue. Also, TUC should not report false items when provided proof of payment."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",Waypoint Resource Group #XXXX is in violation of my 30 day right to dispute. I never received a notice for this collection and only became aware of it when I had my credit pulled and saw it on the report. This should not be on my credit as a collection and I never received anything for this debt
Mortgage,"I was attempting to get a HELOC. I filled out the application and was approved but then the appraisal came back significantly lower than it should have. I looked at the comps and they used homes in the wrong county.

My county has XXXX XXXX  and the county they used has the worst and as such, homes are cheaper. I pointed this out and they said they are "" not allowed '' to challenge the appraisal and I would have to pay {$1000.00} out of pocket for a appraisal. 

It makes no sense that I would need to pay for an appraisal when theirs was done in error. I validated that my application had the correct county listed. So they are either severly incompetent or this is a way to get money while advertising a "" no fee '' HELOC. 

My husband and I carry virtually XXXX debt and high FICOs so I am thinking they don't want to give me the good rate unless I pay something. It seems wrong for me to pay for their mistake. 

Note XXXX is in XXXX counties ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ), XXXX has the highest rated schools and XXXX the lowest - the comps while they say "" XXXX '' are in the incorrect county/school district."
Mortgage,"I wanted my escrow payments removed from my account. I was denied twice and finally received an answer that it is because I had a deferred payment put on the back end years ago. I explained to the company that # 1, I was never told that this would hinder me controlling my own escrow, nor did I sign anything stating this, and # 2 I would be happy to pay that deferred payment back, right now. I have never missed a payment and have a outstanding credit report. I've tried to speak with a higher up manager, only to be denied. It is not right that the mortgage company is holding more money that is owed every year. I would like to be responsible for paying my own taxes."
Debt collection,"I took out a personal loan in XX/XX/XXXX to consolidate credit cards! On my account statement, it shows XX/XX/XXXX that payment was received and credited to my account in the amount of {$1700.00}. On the statement, it also shows XX/XX/XXXX that there was a payment correction in the amount of {$1700.00}. Once I noticed this and began questioning Synchrony, I have not been able to get straight answers. I once was told that they couldn't find the payment and was asked to send them proof. I went to my bank who gave me a copy of the cashed check with my account number written on it and Synchrony Bank stamp on the back to show proof that they cashed it! They corrected the problem but then would continue reversing it. At one time, I was told by a Synchrony representative that they still could not find any proof of the payment. Another time, I was told by a Synchrony representative that the payment was found and her and her manager found that every time the payment was reversed to show payment, the computer was glitching and kicking it back out so her manager was doing an override and that it would be corrected! I just left my bank where the loan is through, and they again verified that the check was cashed by Synchrony! Synchrony Bank has now started the process to take me to court although they have received and cashed the payment in question."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I contacted XXXX and get better understanding off my loan. The loan was originally with XXXX XXXX but they closed down and XXXX bought the loan. 
I don't understand what's going on with this loan ( ACCT : XXXX ). For the month of XX/XX/XXXX {$250.00} were paid to XXXX XXXX/XXXX but the customer service representative told me over the phone that only {$100.00} was received. The total payoff for the loan should be less than {$450.00} at the moment but I'm being told that there's a higher amount and I don't have to pay until XX/XX/XXXX. How is this possible? Could you please help understand what is going on. Attached to this email is a copy of Leave and Earning Statement ( LES ) and Allotment information that shows my payments. I believe the interest rate of this loan has raised without my knowledge and agreement. The company is NOT reporting to the Credit Bureaus at all."
Debt collection,"Security Credit Svcs recently reported a {$1400.00} collection account on my credit report. They are stating that the original creditor is a company called XXXX XXXX. I have never heard of this company, much less had an account with them. Needless to say, I have made Security Credit Svcs aware of this, but they refuse to take it off of my report. When I last spoke with their reps, they said I should dispute the account with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. They said that if the account was not mine, it would be deleted.

Now they are garnishing me again knowing I am a single mother also domestic victims of XXXX minor children and I have left emails but the company manager is so unprofessional he just forwards my email rather than giving me an immediate response. I have had this same balance for three years and they are the most fraudulent sub prime lender out here.

Mortgage,"My wife and I applied for a VA 15 year mortgage through Navy Federal Credit Union in XX/XX/XXXX. More than six weeks later, it was denied for inadequate income. Navy Federal would not consider the more than {$400000.00} in annual income we would receive from the XX/XX/XXXX sale of XXXX XXXX that we owned for more than 30 years. Subsequently, Navy Federal moved us to a conventional, 30 year mortgage at a higher interest rate. 

The failure of Navy Federal to act timely, to look at the source of our income and how long we had that income was unconscionable in our eyes. From day one, it was clear that we had sold our business and our principal source of income was now through a 20 year contract with the employees who bought the business. By the time Navy Federal acted, we were so deep into the process, we were compelled to continue on the path they directed or we would have lost the home. The sellers had grown impatient with the delays. 

Particularly egregious to us was that in reviewing VA lending guidelines, as set out in VA pamphlet 26-7, we should have readily qualified for exceptions to requiring we have our new source of income for 24, as well as 12 months. Prior to starting our own XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX for eleven years. Out of XXXX XXXX, I started with XXXX as a XXXX XXXX and worked my way up to XXXX and XXXX XXXX   XXXX positions before resigning to start XXXX XXXX. With a college education, more than 40 years of work in the field and substantial earnings both before and after the sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, we easily met the VA guidelines which clearly set out that decisions as to income should not be mechanically applied, but consider on a case-by-case basis using education, experience and past income and the likelihood it would continue. Over the five years between XXXX and XXXX we averaged annual growth in excess of 30 percent. 

We do not believe Navy Federal acted in a timely manner to deny our claim, thus denying me an opportunity to go with another lender. Furthermore, we believe Navy Federal, through their actions and failure to follow VA guidelines, deliberately directed us to file for a higher rate conventional mortgage, thus allowing Navy Federal to make more money on the loan."
Mortgage,"To earn our business over other banks, the Wells Fargo representative assured us that if we took out a loan with them, they would eliminate any prepayment penalty for refinancing with Wells Fargo or making early payments. This information was included in the agreement as instructed by the agent. When we refinanced with Wells Fargo, they charged us over {$100000.00} for a prepayment penalty. To justify their action, they said the new rate would replenish this amount in a short period. I was extremely upset, but with no recourse. I especially told them that going forward, under no circumstance, could they charge me again for prepayment penalty. The agent instructed me, as he had done before, to write this agreement, which I did. A few years later, I paid off the loan, but to my shock, I was charged a prepayment penalty of over {$50000.00}. I was furious, and confronted the loan agent admitted they made a mistake, and I should not have been charged a prepayment penalty. They said they would send a new contract excluding the prepayment penalty. When I received the new contract, I noticed they had removed the prepayment penalty and replaced it with repricing for the same penalty amount.

My payments are due on the XXXX of every month I was late but only by 3 days for the month of XXXX and XXXX I made my payments on the XXXX of both of those months. I was trying to chat with them about why they reported me being over 30 days late when that is not possible since i was only 3 days past my due date. But they could not give me a reasonable answer I was well aware of the late fee and excepted the fee I paid all the fees and my minimum payment and then some. I told them that this was being reported on my credit report as inaccurate information and is a deformation of character and not a true picture of what is really being done and all I was told was that since I made the payment after the due date the statement was closed and it is not possible to make a payment to that statement and therefore I am 30 days late. I told them that is a deformation of character and is inaccurate and to please update it to not late and i was told to have a nice day and the chat was ended.

I have reached out to Bayview repeatedly to alert them to a problem with in their system that was not reflecting the correct zero balance for my account. I have not received a response from Bayview. I sent emails to Bayview on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to the  XXXX email address that was provided to me. 
I also spoke to customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about a response. And both told me that my documents still had not yet been updated in the system. 

This is particularly disappointing because since my loan was transferred to Bayview in XX/XX/XXXX, I have had a terrible customer service experience. I started working on a Deed in Lieu around that time and it was stalled for over two years due to lack of responsiveness from XXXX XXXX at Bayview and overall failure from Bayview to move my file forward, despite having had a complete file on three separate occasions. This repeated and seemingly deliberate failure to move forward my deed in lieu requested created a disparate impact on me and also resulted in a financial hardship on me. With the unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices ( UDAAPs ) policy in mind, I filed a complaint with the CFPB last year. After CFPB involvement, my deed in lieu was finally moved forward and eventually approved in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I was advised that any and all debt, fees, and obligations had been dissolved and that I as no longer liable to Bayview. 

However, unfortunately, I continued to receive bills/statements from Bayview. I contacted XXXX XXXX at Bayview on XX/XX/XXXX to inform her of this and she advised that this bill/statement was an error and that Bayviews system simply needed time to update. I contacted her again on XX/XX/XXXX to advise about that I was still receiving bills/statements and she said that the deed had been recorded and that I should not be receiving bills. 

Nevertheless, I continued to receive bills/statements. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX who assured me that the deed in lieu had been approved by Bayview, that everything had been processed on your end and that she showed a XXXX balance for my loan in her system. I am frustrated and upset because I continue to receive bills/ statements and I thought that this matter had been resolved. 

I am reaching out to CFPB as it seems this issue has still not been resolved. So I am asking for you to help me to rectify this situation with Bayview. 

Thank you so much for the help."

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","RE : Account XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madame : I am writing to dispute the account referenced above. I have disputed this account information as inaccurate with the credit bureaus XXXX  and Experian, and you have been able to verify this debt. How is this possible? This is not my account! 

I request that you send me the proper proof that what you are reporting is true, or if you can not, to immediately remove it from my credit report. 

In the event that you can not verify the item pursuant to the FCRA, and you continue to list the disputed item on my credit report I will find it necessary to sue you for improper reporting of information to the credit bureaus regarding my credit history, actual defamation damages and declaratory relief under the FCRA. According to this regulation, I may sue you in any qualified state or federal court, including small claims court in my area. You have severely limited my ability to purchase a home and get a credit card.

In light of the recent changes to the FCRA ( FACTA ), consumers now have the right to go directly to the original creditor and ask for proof of negative information. In addition, court case opinion No. 00-15946 CV-99-00290-D.C. by the US Court of Appeals 9th Circuit, Nelson Vs. Chase Manhattan, the court ruled that the creditor has the responsibility to investigate and make sure that correct information is being reported to the bureaus, and that the consumer has a right to sue under the FCRA, should his or her rights be violated.

While I prefer not to litigate, I will use the courts as needed to enforce my rights under the FCRA. 

I look forward to an uneventful resolution of this matter."

Mortgage,"We took out a loan with SoFi to refinance our home loan. We were looking to go to a 15 year loan and get a lower interest rate. The entire process was very difficult. They made promises they then did not honor including advertising and telling us there would not be a origination fee but when it was time to close there was, they just called it an administration fee. They also had to check our credit twice do to them making an error and having my husbands name as one thing during their process but with our prior lender it was spelled a different way causing two checks with our credit report. 
Throughout the entire loan process there were constant errors in the paperwork and details of the loan. They asked multiple times during the process for proof of flood insurance from our current lender. We sent them our flood documentation including the elevation test and the LOMA that was approved. In 2015 we had been removed from the flood zone by FEMA and no longer required flood insurance. I unfortunately did not save every email interaction with them, however I did find one email from XX/XX/XXXX prior to closing on the loan where we once again informed them we were not in the flood zone. We ended up closing on the loan in XXXX, they had everything they needed and confirmed we did not need flood insurance. 

In XXXX I contacted SoFi after closing on our loan to see how to go about getting the XXXX  % interest rate deduction on me and my husbands personal loans ( we had received a post card that if we refinanced with them we would also get a reduction on our personal loans we had with them, we were also advised this early on in the refinance process over the phone ). I was told the person on the phone did not know anything about this. They ended up advising me to get the interest rate reduction I needed to go online and apply for a new loan and use the option/reason to get a lower interest rate. I did this as advised ( causing another credit check against my credit ) and was denied. At the time my credit score was XXXX but they said my score was too low to approve the loan I was requesting because they advised me to request it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a complaint to their 'CEO ' which I am fairly sure is not really handled by their CEO. After multiple interactions and finally asking them to pull up the original phone call where we were advised we would get the interest rate reduction, I received an email they could not give us the reduction but they would give us {$50.00} ( the said the reduction would have resulted in {$28.00} savings over the life of the loan ). None of my other concerns were addresses and it was dropped. 

In XXXX we began receiving multiple messages stating we needed flood insurance again. My husband and I spoke with multiple people every week. We continued to be advised we just had to send in our LOMA. We would send it in and they would come back and ask again. They could not ever find our account. We ended up sending it to the person who handled the above complaint hoping she could help on XX/XX/XXXX. We never heard a response. The confusion has something to do with SoFi and the company who services their loans not having the same account number. We sent the flood documentation an estimate of 6 times from XXXX through XXXX ( they would call every couple of weeks, we would send it every couple of weeks ). We then began receiving letters stating they would force us into flood insurance and purchase it for us. At this point I had contacted FEMA asking for help who also advised the LOMA is what we should need to send them. We were not getting any help from anyone to understand what we needed to do. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the CEO again, I received a generic email from someone saying someone from the mortgage team would get back to me. I never heard anything back. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed the 'CEO ' again letting them know I would be contacting CFPB because I did not know what else to do. I again received a generic response stating they would be forwarding it to the mortgage team and someone would get back to me. It is now the XXXX and I still have not heard back from anyone. 

We did however receive an email on XX/XX/XXXX notifying us that they had purchased flood insurance using our escrow for {$1700.00}. We have not been advised yet how they will pay our other stuff since our escrow will now not have money in it. I assume we will be getting a bill or something soon. We are begging for help. We thought we were doing everything correctly. We continued to do what we were asked to do which was to send in our LOMA. They would not help us understand what was needed to prevent this and then spent our escrow without our permission. 

We do not know if we need to contact a lawyer or what to do next. We did go back to FEMA and are requesting a new LOMA even though we have been advised LOMA 's do not expire. We are in the waiting process for that. 

At this point we would like to refinance our loan with a different company but can not afford to pay another {$4000.00} closing costs with a different company. We feel we should have been advised prior to closing that we were going to be required to get flood insurance if we refinanced with them or at least had someone help us to understand what they needed before they just spent our escrow. We feel we took this loan out based on false information from SoFi. I do have some emails that I have kept during this process. Please let me know if there is anything else we need to try to resolve this issue. Thank you for your support."

Long Story Short, I get calls from US bank on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX and they collect a payment from me, not enough to cover my minimum payment, I again mention to them about a deferment option and they are vague and do not give me a definite answer.

Unfortunately, I did not get a screenshot of the dates XXXX told me but I know what I read and I know what I was told. 

XXXX ) I requested XXXX to provide proof of correspondence but she could not provide any proof that anything was sent. She just told me she could not help me since I said I did not receive notice through email from XXXX. I checked everywhere in my email and even provided proof that I did not receive notice. So now, you are telling your first "" notice '' you sent was in XXXX? Kingston Data and Credit can not make up their mind of when they sent notice. What is the actual truth here? 

XXXX ) I requested a physical notice instead. I confirmed with another representative if it was sent, and the communication was once again very stale and they worked as if they did not care. But they confirmed it was sent. 
8 ) I received the ONLY ONE notice through physical mail. However, the amount changed once again. They added {$80.00} to my credit, but used the real amount on paper.

9 ) The company gave yet again gave another stale answer that does not resolve any issues with their company. Kingston Data is working illegally. They do not send a written notice, will only add to your credit, will try to lie about sending notice to avoid accountability, and then continue to lie.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I purchased a used vehicle from XXXX used car dealership in XXXX of XXXX at over {$14000.00} ( extremely high interest rate from their predatory lending ).

Mortgage,"Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CO XXXX Loan # : XXXX Lender : Mr. Cooper ( Nationstar Mortgage LLC ) Statement Date : XX/XX/year> Payoff Good Through : XX/XX/year> Complaint Summary I requested a mortgage payoff statement from Mr. Cooper in XX/XX/year> to complete a refinance. Their Loan Estimate used an understated payoff amount of {$710000.00} when my actual documented payoff amount was {$710000.00}, as confirmed by Mr. Coopers own payoff quote issued XX/XX/year>. 

This inaccurate figure resulted in a misleading Loan Estimate that claimed I would owe no money at closing, which was materially false. I only discovered the real payoff through a separate communication. 

The daily interest shown in their internal calculations also appeared to be incorrect ( based on ~ $ XXXX at XXXX %, when my actual interest rate was 7.125 %, and actual daily interest was {$130.00} ). This again made the refinance look more favorable than it truly was. 

Additionally, they promised a funding date of XX/XX/year>, which another broker confirmed was logistically impossible under federal guidelines, further misleading me into believing their offer could close faster. 

These practices violate the Truth in Lending Act, the RESPA Section 8 ( a ) anti-kickback/misrepresentation rules, and likely state consumer protection statutes governing deceptive lending. 

I am requesting that : The CFPB investigate Mr. Coopers use of intentionally understated payoff quotes in Loan Estimates. 

Mr. Cooper be required to provide corrected disclosures and refrain from using estimates that underrepresent true payoffs.

They informed me they can contact XXXX XXXX or I can contact them in which I replied I will resolve the matter with XXXX XXXX. 

I then contacted XXXX XXXX and according to their statement I still owed them this amount. I know I paid this at their offices but did not have the invoice readily available as I moved to another state. I told them I will get the invoice and the have to give me some time as I have to find and pack out several boxes in the hope to find the receipt.

United Accounts then proceeded to still report me to the credit bureaus even though they were aware of my dispute. I contacted them again and asked if it would be better to pay this amount again or to continue with the dispute as I know this was paid before and I am in the process of purchasing a house ( the negative report could affect my ability to purchase my house ). The lady said I should pay the bill and they will remove the report from the credit bureaus but it would take until end XXXX. They also said my loan company could contact them and they will give proof of my paid account. I proceeded to pay United Accounts the complete amount. 

The next day, I asked them to please supply me with proof of payment in order for my loan company to take the negative report out of my file. United accounts refused saying they are not allowed to give me any proof of payment because I am a resident of Wyoming. I continued to ask if she is saying that they may not give me any form of proof that I paid them and she kept on saying they may not according to law. 

The last lady I contacted was named XXXX and she said my bank should fax them a credit release before they will give us ANY proof of payment.

After speaking to XXXX and getting a better understanding of the next steps, I called Hillcrest. Twice I spoke to XXXX. His tone was nonprofessional throughout the conversation. He seemed like everything I was speaking didn't make sense to him and repeated things I had said in a condescending tone. He only referred to me as "" miss '' which is extremely misogynistic. When he and I came to a disagreement in the amount of settlement offered from the original company, he said he could not do that. I said okay and thanked him for his time just before he threatened that he will report me to the credit bureaus and then he hung up on me! 
I called back to file a former complaint with the company and again was met with extreme unprofessional mannerisms and a general neglect for compassionate customer services. Supposed manager XXXX XXXX refused to take my complaint. He audibly laughed at me when I asked him about their employee training regime and complained about the lack of customer service skills. While laughing, he refused to hear my complaint or even anything I had to say. He also hung up the phone on me.

Debt collection,"Subject : Notice of Dispute Inaccurate Charge-Off Reporting for Capital One To Whom It May Concern, I am formally disputing the accuracy of an account being reported on my credit report by Capital One, listed under account number ending in XXXX * * * * * *. This account is currently reported as charged off with a balance of {$2900.00}. 

I believe the reporting of this account as a charge-off is inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading, and I am requesting that you conduct an investigation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681i.

Reason for Dispute : This account may have been securitizedsold to a trust or third party as part of a pooled asset-backed securitywhich would indicate Capital One no longer legally owns or holds the debt, making it improper for them to report it as a charge-off with an outstanding balance. 

According to the FCRA, all information reported must be complete and accurate. If the debt was sold or otherwise transferred through securitization, Capital One can not legally report it as an ongoing charge-off obligation. 

I am requesting that you : 1. Investigate the accuracy of this charge-off in light of securitization.

2. Request documentation from Capital One proving their legal right to continue reporting this account, including proof of ownership.

3. Delete or correct the entry if verification can not be provided. 

Please also update me with the results of your investigation in writing within 30 days as required by the FCRA. 

I have enclosed a copy of my ID and proof of address for verification."

I am not satisfied with my previous dispute because I have reason to believe that this company did not follow reasonable procedures when investigating the items that I disputed on my credit report, I believe that the company 's investigation was done by an automated eOscar system which is why the investigation yielded inaccurate and false information 15 US Code 1681i ( Section 5 paragraph A ) states that Treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) In general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall ( i ) PROMPTLY DELETE that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation ; and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer.

Debt collection,I took a loan out with Regional finance in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX rolled over the balance from the first loan into a 2nd loan. I fell behind off and on as my business struggled. I communicated with the company to the best of my ability and was able to defer a couple of payments in an attempt to stay current. I fell behind again but was still communicating and paying what I could. One month towards the end of XXXX I called to make a payment and was told my account was in legal status. I made the payment and asked if I was being sued. The rep over the phone stated that they were unsure why I was in legal but assured me that as long as I kept making payments that I should be ok. After that conversation I was getting calls from the Regional Finance Corporate office 3 or more times a day. Regional was harassing me with multiple calls in an attempt to intimidate me into paying the entire remaining balance. I repeatedly informed them that I had made my monthly payment and asked them to stop calling multiple times a day and to send me copies of all paperwork associated with my accounts. The calls did not stop until I filed a complaint with the State of Texas. Regional refused to send me copies of my paperwork. I was eventually served papers for a lawsuit brought on by Regional Finance. I showed up to court and paid XXXX XXXX  for the mediation.I found out at court that Regional Finance is not showing the courts the correct documents for the correct loan. The Lawyer for Regional Finance showed me that their records show I have not made a payment since XXXX. I pulled up my bank statements to show the lawyer that I have been consistently paying for months. The lawyer stated he could not help as he was only authorized to mediate for the full remaining balance and gave me paperwork with another lawyers info. The Regional Finance Lawyer and I returned to the Judge to set a date for XXXX to return to mediation in the hopes we could get the issue sorted out. I received an email stating that now Regional has filed a motion in court for a pre-trail hearing. I also received a credit alert this week stating Regional is reporting my account delinquent all of a sudden even though I am current with all of my payments.

Mortgage,"I am filing this complaint regarding Mr. Cooper 's mishandling of a mortgage recast request, which has resulted in unnecessary financial harm and raises questions about their business practices. 
After selling my other home, I contacted Mr. Cooper in early XX/XX/year> to request a recast of my mortgage using the proceeds from that sale. On XX/XX/year>, Mr. Cooper confirmed receipt of all necessary materials : My formal recast request The required recast processing fee A {$300000.00} principal payment intended for the recast Despite having everything needed to proceed, Mr. Cooper did not take timely action. On XX/XX/year>, I followed up via their customer service chat, concerned that delays would result in additional interest chargesdespite the principal payment already being in their possession. 
On XX/XX/year>, Mr. Cooper sent me a recast agreement indicating the new loan terms would not take effect until XX/XX/year>. This delay means I am required to make XXXX additional full monthly payments at the higher original amount, including interest on the principal that has already been applied. In effect, I am paying interest on funds that have already been used to reduce my loan balance. 
I immediately called to express concern and requested that the recast be made effective as of XX/XX/year>, which I believe is a fair and reasonable compromise given that all documentation and funds were submitted by XXXX. My request was denied, and the representative was unable to provide any substantive justification for the XX/XX/XXXX effective date. 
I believe this delay is financially punitive to borrowers and disproportionately benefits the servicer by allowing them to collect interest unnecessarily. Mr. Cooper 's actions demonstrate, at minimum, a lack of transparency and urgency in servicing customer requests, and at worst, a conflict of interest in retaining interest income at the borrowers expense. 
I am requesting that this matter be investigated and that Mr. Cooper be held accountable for their practices in handling mortgage recast requests. I am also seeking reimbursement or credit for the additional interest charged as a result of the delayed effective date."

Mortgage,"Hi, I have an FHA loan with an origination date of XX/XX/11 and have been paying monthly PMI since then which is about 8 years now. Per online regulations at the time and some real estate help and HUD guidelines, was told that once your "" loan to value '' ( LTV ) ratio reached 80 % of appraised value, PMI should be cancelled. 
My house value has gone up considerably and I have written to Carrintgon Mortgage Services couple of times asking to have the PMI removed, they come back saying ( to suit their convenience ) that they will not look at the current value but, the original appraised value. This is really unfair, since when I bought the house in 2011, this was the expectation. 
I have not missed any payments and feel that CMS can not use whatever suits or benefits it to not waive my PMI. This is per HUD guidelines, and it is important that rules also help FHA loan consumers while protecting mortgage companies. 
Thanks in advance for your help in removing my PMI by Carrintgon Mortgage Services and use current value of the house for LTV, with loan origination in 2011 and no missed payments.

1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) : Statutory damages up to {$1000.00} per debt collector, per action.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), Pub. L. 108159 Provides for fraud alerts ( 605A ) and credit freezes. 
Requires creditors and reporting agencies to provide victims with account documentation. 

Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) Criminalizes the fraudulent use of another persons identifying information.

Notice of Intent to Sue If the above demands including account removal, production of validation records, and payment of statutory damages are not fully satisfied within fifteen ( 15 ) days of receipt of this notice, I will file a civil lawsuit against XXXX XXXX and Transworld Systems Inc. 

For clarity, removal of these fraudulent accounts from my credit report alone will not eliminate liability. If the statutory damages totaling {$3000.00} are not paid in full, I will still pursue civil litigation to recover damages, attorneys fees, and all other relief permitted under law. 

These fraudulent accounts are causing me financial and reputational harm. I hold no liability for any charges, balances, or debts related to these accounts."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I sent Experian a dispute through the mail and they have failed to investigate/reinvestigate my dispute. I have attached the documents to be corrected/investigated. In addition to the attached documents I have also noticed that the payment history for XXXX XXXX is being reported differently across the 3 bureaus. According to XXXX I understand that their reporting the same information to all 3 bureaus so what Experian is reporting can not be accurate and free from error. In addition Experian is not providing the number or name of contact at XXXX and is in violation of FCRA.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Once I realized in mid XXXX that my 4 accounts were reduced to 3 accounts with Navient student loan company, i contacted them. First i was told it was still 4 accounts and that I am not due to pay any amount since my loans are on administrative for forbearance. Same year, I got a credit score report with my score plunging down due to derogatory reports from Navient that one out of four loans was in charge off/collection. I started to make numerous phone calls, send emails and postal mails with dates. 

I would stay long hours on the phone to resolve the issue, I even disputed credit reports through the credit unions all to no avail. My credit score continues to be affected by this monthly derogatory report and am not able to qualify for any credits whatsoever because of it. 

I made many calls requesting that my one account gets moved back to the current accounts like my 3 other accounts. I sent so many emails until they stopped accepting emails from me and I would get undeliverable messages from Navient. I do not know who else to go to and what else to do. Legal actions do take time and money so I was advised to file a complaint through this website. 

The last time I tried to solve this was Friday XX/XX/XXXX on or around XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX then XXXX XXXX, then XXXX XXXX who went through all the payments and determined that the error was made in the manner they split my payment.

I always made one consolidated payment for my 4 student loan accounts that is sending only one payment. According to XXXX, she determined from her search that at sometime in XXXX of XXXX they made the mistake and missed one account when they were crediting all 4 accounts. 

According to XXXX, she said that in XXXX, they reported the account since it was in collection/charge off to credit reporting agency. XXXX finally indicated that this can be fixed since she is able to locate the reason and it can only be done by customer service. XXXX XXXX then transferred me to customer service escalation team rep XXXX XXXX to fix the problem. XXXX said she will contact the necessary departments and get it resolved by pulling it out from collection/charge off. 

I have continued to be in contact with Navient staffs and no matter the promises I got that it will be fixed, it was never done. I plead that you help me resolve this as my credit score has been bad for years because of this monthly reports. In addition to these derogatory reports, the loan amount continues to increase. I even sort an attorney to discuss this, after the attorney reviewed all the files I sent to him, he wrote them and was on the phone with me and them in XX/XX/XXXX when they said it will be resolved by customer service escalation team, XXXX."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","In response to the letter I received on XX/XX/2020, Case # XXXX, Consumer # XXXX. I requested a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of a disputed bankruptcy on my consumer report. I have not gotten a response from Lexis Nexis. I was told over the phone that they get the information directly from the courts. I have received a letter from the bankruptcy court confirming they do not give out personal information to 3rd parties. I asked that they verify that it is in fact my bankruptcy and they failed to do so. The bankruptcy remains on my consumer report as incomplete and inaccurate information. They failed to verify my full name, full social security number, amount of debt in the bankruptcy and my full address associated with this bankruptcy. Because of this inaccurate and incomplete information being reported the credit bureaus are reporting it because they get this information from Lexis Nexis. I am attaching a letter from Bankruptcy court supporting my issue."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I sent multiple credit disputes with these companies asking them to investigate items on my credit report that are not mine. I sent in a report from the federal trade commission with my personal statement. I also sent in a detailed letter referencing federal laws that the bureaus must abide by. Based on their lack of responding in the time frame and their investigation results they have not abused by laws.
Debt collection,"Please be advised that this is my 2nd attempt at getting this incorrect collection removed from my Equifax credit report. I have reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX in reference to this collection and they still haven't provide me with the requested documentation that VALIDATES this debt properly. This is not my debt and I am requesting that it is removed immediately. This collection is harming my credit report and it is violating my HIPPA Rights. Please be advised that this is my SECOND WRITTEN REQUEST asking you to remove the unverified accounts listed below that remain on my credit report in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681. You are required under the FCRA to have properly verified the accuracy of an account listed on my credit report. In the results of your first re-investigation, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly. Where are the documents that you used to verify these accounts? What is the name of the person in your company who verified these accounts? What documents did they use to verify them? Please provide me with the name of that individual, their business address, and telephone number. Blacks Law Dictionary,  9th Edition, 2009, defines Verify as, 1 ) "" To prove to be true ; toconfirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate. '' 2 ) to confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit ; to swear to the truth of.  '' and Verification as, Confirmation of correctness, truth or authenticity, by affidavit, oath, or deposition. Affidavit of truth of a matter stated and object of verification is to assure good faith in averments or statements of a party. What this means is that your company must be willing and able to produce a document in your files that proves the account ( s ) in dispute belong to me and the information being reported is accurate and you must be able to do this in a court of law if I file a lawsuit against you. Someone in your company must authenticate the documents in your files that were used to verify the disputed accounts and to do this they must have 1st hand knowledge of the alleged account ( s ) and all that has ever transpired for the alleged account ( s ), under oath and under the penalty of perjury. As I am sure that you are well aware, current Federal case law states that, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from other sources. The Courts have also ordered that a Reinvestigation that merely shifts the burden back to the consumer and the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). You have ignored my request to provided me with the documents that you have in your files that you used to verify the disputed accounts which means that you have NOT verified or you can not verify any of these accounts and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me for negligent noncompliance ( Section 617 ) if you fail to comply with this Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA. I demand the following accounts be verified or deleted immediately.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Hello, My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I noticed Wednesday, XX/XX/2022 these accounts that I have listed have been opened using my personal information. I am requesting the following accounts be removed from my credit report. I am a victim of identity theft. I did not make any of these charges. The last few years Ive had to jump around a lot from place to place because I was not in the best space mentally and that led to me becoming unstable in other areas of my life. See, I lost my girlfriend a few years ago and she was eight months pregnant with our baby girl. A driver under the influence rammed into my girlfriends vehicle. Neither one of them made it and that turned my world upside down. I stayed place to place where ever I could and my personal information was stolen in the mist of it all. Please delete these items as soon as possible. I reported the theft of my identity to the Federal Trade Commission and I also have enclosed copies of the Federal Trade Commissions Identity Theft Affidavit. Please delete the items as soon as possible."
Mortgage,"MY mortgage was paid off/ transfer on XX/XX/XXXX. Freedom mortgage is still holding XXXX} in loss draft and have not released it. It has been six weeks and many phone calls with no help. Customer service has sent 3 emails requesting the money be released and returned. On XX/XX/XXXX the insurance department notified loss draft that Freedom no longer controlled the money and it needed to be transferred. As of today XX/XX/XXXX, customer service notified me that loss draft still had the money and they were emailing/ requesting the money be released. I spent 45 minutes with them. I started with customer service and was told I need to talk to loss draft, loss draft told me I needed to talk to customer service and transferred me back to customer service, they told me I needed to talk with loss draft. I explained loss draft had sent me back to customer service. Customer service then sent another email requesting they release the money. My understanding is that not one of the previous emails has ever been responded to. Each call assures me that the issue is being addressed and I will be receiving my money so I can in turn pay the contractor the remaining amount on the repair completion. Six weeks since my loan was satisfied with Freedom Mortgage and they are still holding my money. At best it will be another two weeks but I have no hope of that happening. All work is completed on my home and the contractor is waiting for the rest of the money. I am responsible to make that payment even when Freedom Mortgage feels they can hold my money. I informed each person I spoke with tonight that it was my last call with them and I would be filing a complaint because nothing was getting done at Freedom Mortgage to correct this."
Mortgage,"I had completed a divorce in XXXX of 2017 and was awaiting my ex-wife to sign the quitclaim deed, to have her name removed from the mortgage title.

The mortgage company XXXX Planet Home Lending , LLC XXXX stated they received all documentation but when I took the next steps to refinance the mortgage in solely my name the mortgage company refused and are trying to add my ex-wife 's name to the refinance. They will no longer accept any payments and instead return any and all mortgage payment attempts. 

I have become so utterly defeated with this my mortgage lender where now I have no other options but to sell my home where my children stay and attempt to find somewhere else to live.

Mortgage,"I applied for a refinance with Quicken loans in mid XXXX. I was told the terms would be 3.99 % {$100000.00} loan with 2.125 % points, with those terms, I agreed to put a "" good faith deposit '' down of {$500.00} ( no one from Quicken told me that they could change the rates and terms after I put the deposit down ). Our appraisal came back at {$140000.00} and all of the sudden all rates and terms changed. ( I went to XXXX XXXX Mortgages and once again had an appraisal done 1 week later and it was {$160000.00}, {$37000.00} more! ). Anyway, Quicken changed my rates and terms no less than 5 times, even changing terms 2 times in one day! I thought good faith meant good faith by both parties. Their actions were not fair and entirely too confusing. Even my loan officer said she did not know what was going on. Of course, I no longer felt comfortable letting this company deal with my mortgage so I went to Ruoff and closed within a few weeks with no issues, but I am now out {$500.00} with Quicken and they refuse to return it. During this process, we also received calls from several different people from Quicken after we told them that we no longer wanted to work with them and some were even threatening, saying since we already applied with them, no other company would take us and we should just go with them. I don't think it is fair that I signed the "" good faith deposit '' saying I liked the terms and wanted to proceed, yet they did not show "" good faith '' back by changing terms over 5 times for no apparent reason. I think I should get my deposit back, as I did what I was suppose to do, they were the ones who did not. If this is allowed to continue, they could tell customers a false great rate and terms, take their money, then change terms and customers either have to accept the new terms or lose their money, it is not fair."

As XX/XX/XXXX my modification has not been completed. My loan is in limbo and I have been making payments that are not credited to my loan. I call both companies and everyday. XXXX told me today XX/XX/XXXX that they can not get the terms of the loan to match the terms that Shellpoint sent. XXXX says Shellpoint is not responding, Shellpoint says XXXX has everything they need. 

Originally, I was told that in order to start the trial modification I would need to pay {$10000.00} prior to the first payment in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I expressed my concern about paying {$10000.00} essentially a down payment that was not noted in the agreement. There was no mention of the {$10000.00} anywhere, I went out of my way to continue to tell Shellpoint that this didn't seem right. Well my fears are now validated because XXXX indicates the {$10000.00} is the very reason they can not process my loan - because the {$10000.00} was not spelled out in the modification paperwork as a down payment - it is essentially showing that I made all the trial payments as a lump sum. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX nothing is resolved and I am still limbo with this loan. Its is extremely hard to get anyone on the phone at either company.

Mortgage,I have applied for a mortgage modification because I have fallen behind on my payments due to my wife and I losing our jobs. I have since been able to make my payments but I can not catch them up. I can not afford payment arrangements because the mortgage servicer Mr. Cooper will not spread them out over a long enough period of time. 5 months ago I applied for the modification and provided all required documents at that time. The underwriter did not read all of the documents provided and requested the same documents over again with no explanation as to what was wrong with what was provided. In late XXXX I spoke to their customer service agent whom went over the documents I provided with me and stated all required documents where there. The underwriter reissued the same request for documents in XXXX. I called and spoke to the customer service representative again and they stated they saw that the documents were uploaded.

I have sent proof including a certified notarized police report proving I was in deed in XXXX at the time. My Spouse and I were on this trip. They have continued to report this to credit agencies causing my credit score to plummet. Consequently XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have lowered my credit limits.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I XXXX XXXX.

If XXXX XXXX  ever decided to take legal action on this indebtedness, they will find the case thrown out of court with prejudice. Accordingly, the only thing that XXXX XXXX  can do is damage my personal credit rating to partake in this fraud.

I reported this as fraud on my card. This was not stated as a fee anywhere on the payment page. I also thought it was odd that they did not list the actual terms and conditions of the agreement anywhere on the payment page. I have photo documentation of the payment page and terms and conditions. I'm pretty sure it is against the FDCPA to charge additional fees prior to a post-dated payment when "" no fee '' was stated explicitly on their payment page."

Debt collection,"To whom it may concern, I am contacting to submit a formal complaint with Transworld Information Systems ( TSI ) a debt collection agency and TSI agent XXXX XXXX. Below are a list of concerns I have regarding this individual, TSI, and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Incorrect Balance : I have been informed by the original creditor ( XXXX XXXX ) that I owed approximately {$410.00}, not {$960.00}. As the security deposit would have been added to the {$960.00} before being sent to TSI. This balance also fails to account for a rent refund of {$600.00}, which I paid on XX/XX/XXXX. I had already moved out of the apartment at that point. This would result in a net refund of {$180.00} owed to me. 
Dispute Ignored : I formally disputed the debt both by phone and email, yet TSI proceeded as if the dispute had not been submitted or properly reviewed.

Lack of Communication Between Parties : TSI claims they contacted the apartment complex regarding my dispute, while the apartment insists they have received no contact from TSI. Both parties have also refused any further contact with each other so Ive had to go back and forth with both XXXX XXXX and TSI. 
Pressure and Misleading Statements : TSI agent XXXX XXXX attempted to pressure me into paying the full {$960.00}, falsely stating that doing so would be doing me a favor, and provided inconsistent due dates XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX have all been mentioned. I have also been contacted on XX/XX/XXXX, informing me of a 60 day grace period and to my knowledge the most recent due date I had received was still XX/XX/XXXX. Now Im back in the grace period? 
No Proper Validation of Debt : I requested written validation of the debt and proof that TSI has the legal right to collect on behalf of XXXX XXXX. This has not been provided.

System Glitch on Payment Attempt : I tried to initiate a XXXX payment plan via TSIs portal, but the payment failed and returned an Overpayment error. I have screenshots as proof.

Voiceless Contact Attempts : TSI initially contacted me from unidentified XXXX phone numbers, often not leaving voicemails, which feels deceptive. 

Biggest red flag : Attempting to contact my family members. XXXX called my dad on XX/XX/XXXX. Stating he was with TSI, a financial service and asked to speak with me. Admitting he was with TSI, a publicly known debt collection agency means he admitted to my dad that he was a debt collector."

Debt collection,"Happy Holidays ; Please remove this unknown collection account from all the major credit bureaus for failure to provide me the required documents as requested per the laws under FDCPA. A Months ago, I initiated a dispute with the MidlandMCM directly asking for all the documents and disclosure so I can validate the accuracy of this alleged debt, but they failed to provide me ALL the required documents. But after reading several cases online, where the company was sued for a similar situation, and specifically a case of "" State of Texas vs. Midland Funding and their other entities and group '', where the plaintiff asked for documents and they failed to provide them. The AG outlined what the plaintiff was asking for and their nature of business. Please see detail below : 9.3 The electronic portfolios of these charged off accounts acquired by Defendants contain limited categories of information about the debt. Typically, Defendants do not acquire the underlying credit agreements, payment history, or statements ( or "" media '' ) but retain the right to purchase the documentation from the original creditor at a later date. 9.4 Defendants ' collection activities prefer "" efficiency '' and profits over compliance with Texas debt collection laws. Defendants chum out millions of collection letters and millions of telephone calls from its call centers in Arizona, Minnesota and XXXX, often using incomplete and/or inaccurate electronic information purchased from original creditors. Consumers complain Defendants have targeted the wrong person for collection or are attempting to collect debts that have been fully or partially paid or settled. Consumers also complain that Defendants pursue them for collection of old debts for which they do not have any records and are beyond the statute of limitations and credit reporting periods. Defendants ' form collection letters contain very little information about the debt, no supporting documentation, and no proof that ownership of the debt has been transferred to Defendants. When a citizen contacts Defendants to dispute a debt or the amount of the balance owed, or to ask for additional information, little or nothing is done to investigate or verify the legitimacy of the debt. 
9.5 Consumers complain that when they tell Defendants they do not owe the debt Defendants refuse to provide documentation to verify the debt and turn the tables on the consumer to prove the debt is not owed or not owed in the amount alleged. Consumers complain that this practice has resulted in loss of credit rating, inability to refinance their homes, and even loss of job opportunities, in addition to the aggravation of being harassed by a debt collector who refuses to verify the debt. Some consumers pay Defendants just to avoid a false report to the credit reporting agencies or avoid the harassment of a lawsuit.

A debt collector and thst bought the debt even not after 180 days to legally fault and anyway they reported on a different report that my account last payment was in XXXX when the other agencies had charged off the entire debt and used as a loss to the shareholders so they also never once made a collection call of sent notice so I could dispute snd also verify the value of the debt so they just came and actually legally had legal documents to take my car they never did one Indiana law to legitimize the repossession of my vehicle because they did not sell the debt in i order to collect my property especially if my other credit report Is showing the balance Id accruing interest after it was charged off because the difference in the charge off amount and the fact the are not reporting that payments I did make after my charge off"

They began mocking me and asked if I had a brain injury or something. This was deeply offensive and triggering. I expressed that I was trying to understand the account and figure out a resolution, but they kept cutting me off, speaking over me, and escalating their tone. I felt harassed, humiliated, and completely disregarded as a human being. 

I also stated that I had been attempting to work with XXXX regarding XXXX protections since this debt is from XXXX and falls within my eligibility window. The representative said XXXX doesnt own the debt anymore and that theres nothing they can do, which contradicts the SCRA process and gives me concern that they are deliberately misleading or withholding relief options.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I have a public record & XXXX XXXX entry that was placed on my credit report and I have been trying for over 12 months to get this entry removed. I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how XXXX, Transunion and XXXX verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a law firm, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. 
Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call XXXX back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. All 3 major bureaus refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","In late XX/XX/2021, the PHH Morgage company reported my account 30 days late. I made a payment on their electronic phone line on or about XXXX XXXX. A few days later I realized that my payment had not been drafted from my account and I called them. I was informed that there was a payment that had been rejected. I contacted my bank to verify this information and they told me that no payment had been attempted from the mortgage company. At that point it was after my 15 day grace period so I was worried about late fees. I called the Morgage company to make a payment and tell them about what was going on in an attempt to get the fees waived. After all, we are in a pandemic and every XXXX  mattered. They told me no they would not waive the fee and that I needed to make the payment right away. I made the full payment right there over the phone with the rep. I woke up a few days later with a late payment notification from XXXX XXXX. I was very upset because I had been in contact with them about the issue. At that point, I called them multiple times only to hear that it was nothing they could do. I spoke to multiple managers about what happened and I was told to file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I asked the company for a letter from stating that my account was current and that it was in good standing and was never late. I added this letter to my dispute. The disbute came back verified, nothing was changed on my credit report and I dont understand how. Since my disbute I have called them once a month and I still havent received any positive solution. I dont know why they are unwilling to work with me on a system error. I have never had this issue of being late on a Morgage before. I am filing this complaint because I have tried to contact this company multiple times to rectify this issue and they have basically laughed in my face and told me to handle it with my credit report. This late payment has dramatically affected me and their reporting was not fair or accurate. Since then, they have transferred my Morgage to another lender."

Pennymac paid the insurance late, and the insurance company sent me a notice stating they were going to cancel -- a notice which was sent to me AFTER the deadline date in that letter! So I called Pennymac again and we had a conference call with the insurance company, and even though Pennymac paid them MONTHS LATE - THE insurance company rep said they would reinstate it. 

I DID NOT LEARN until later that Pennymac had bought it's own EXPENSIVE INSURANCE AND STARTED CHARGING ME EXORBITANT AMOUNT FOR IT. 

Because they refused to take responsibility for this and blamed me, and they would not tell me how to appeal or how to contact their superior in the company, at the time I had to settle for a payment plan where they added only part of the amount per month to make up for the EXCESSS I NOW KNOW THEY CAUSED. 

i AM NOW TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO WILL HELP WITH THIS BECAUSE I DO NOT OWE FOR PENNYMAC 'S NEGLIGENCE. aFTER READING THAT THEY HAVE DONE THIS TO OTHERS, I AM CERTAIN THIS IS A SCAM. 


My original payment was XXXX and is now XXXX - AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE FULL AMOUNT. THIS WAS ADDED TO MY MORTGAGE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. AS SOON AS i REALIZED THEY WERE DOING THIS, i GOT MY OWN INSURANCE POLICY, BUT THEY DID THIS WITHOUT TELLING ME AND NOW EXPECT ME TO COVER THE COST. 

IF THEY ARE DOING THIS AND GETTING KICKBACKS FROM EXPENSIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED. 

I WANT THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF PENNYMAC 'S ADDED INSURANCE REFUNDED TO ME."

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I filed for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. My home mortgage prior to the filing was serviced with America 's Servicing Company ( a subsidiary of Wells Fargo ). Shortly after I filed bankruptcy, America 's Servicing Company sold my mortgage to Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX A Notice of Electronic Filing of my reaffirmation agreement with Wells Fargo ( my home mortgage ) was filed through the bankruptcy court. My bankruptcy was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX. Shortly after the discharge, Wells Fargo submitted paperwork to me explaining the transferring of the account. Since Wells Fargo acquired my home loan, no payment history has been reported to ANY of the three credit bureaus. According to a letter from Wells Fargo, my home loan is being treated as reaffirmed and my payment history is being submitted to all three credit bureaus. This is not the case. In XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed my XXXX credit report. Wells Fargo updated the account. XXXX  attached a statement stating the MY statement to include Account Closed by Consumers request. This is an inaccurate statement and I have once again disputed this information and uploaded supporting documents to my XXXX  account. I have included my payment history that I requested from Wells Fargo establishing that my account is current and has never been late. I am unsure as to WHOM owns my mortgage and to WHOM I am actually making payments to if XXXX  is claiming my home mortgage is discharged through Bankruptcy. I had three other loans I reaffirmed, all three are being reported to the credit bureaus correctly. I am only having issues with my Wells Fargo account."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I am distressed that you have included the information below in my credit profile and that you have failed to maintain reasonable procedures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit reports you publish. Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information. Every step must be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct.

HI, I have contacted the two of the credit bureaus about the posted companies. I am not familiar and I do not own a vehicle at all, nor have I made any inquiries. I've been a victim of 2 major company breaches and one other with my email and telephone number. I am in tears not just because I am seeing this again, the credit score companies are not listening and my credit score went down by almost 100 points! This is so upsetting.

Debt collection,"I understand the importance of removing any incorrect accounts from my credit report in accordance with FCRA 605B. Could you please take a look at the documents? I've observed that some of the listed accounts seem to be inaccurate, which is worrying to me."
Debt collection,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against a debt collection agency that contacted me under false pretenses and potentially violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regulations. 

Incident Summary : On [ insert date of phone call ], I received a phone call from a representative who failed to identify themselves as a debt collector. During the call : The caller asked about an account allegedly related to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

I acknowledged prior dealings with XXXX XXXX and explained that I had been told the matter would be written off. 

The representative insisted I still owed money and represented themselves in a manner that implied they were a lawyer or legal representative of the company. 

At no point did they disclose that the call was from a debt collector or that any information obtained would be used for that purpose, as required under the FDCPA. 

I requested debt validation via postal mail, not email, per my rights under the FDCPA and CFPB guidelines. 

The representative told me they were not required to send documentation via mail and insisted on email correspondence, despite my explicit refusal. 


Eventually, I did receive something by mail after ending the call, at which point it became clear the company was in fact a debt collector. 

Why I'm Filing This Complaint : Failure to identify as a debt collector at the start of the call. 

Misrepresentation or deceptive practices, including the implication that the caller was a lawyer or affiliated with one. 

Failure to honor my preferred communication method, as I explicitly requested written communication via U.S. Mail. 

Incorrect information about my rightsspecifically, the claim that debt validation no longer needs to be mailed upon request. 


I am requesting that your office investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with all consumer protection laws. 

Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required. I am prepared to provide a more detailed account of the conversation and a copy of the mailed communication I later received. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
Debt collection,"I want to stress that I did not give written permission for these specific transactions to be included in my consumer report. At no point did I authorize these entries, and their presence on my report is unwarranted. Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity. I trust that you will handle this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Please confirm the removal of these transactions from my report as soon as possible. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a summons to appear in court for an alleged credit card debt from Midland Credit Management. I was later visited by the city police XX/XX/2021 regarding the original summons I received on XX/XX/2021 from Attorney XXXX XXXX, XXXX. From my understanding of consumer law, according to 15 USC 1692 ( e ) this section is titled false or misleading representation, Midland Credit Management is in violation of my consumer rights and I want to compensated for the damages which I am entitled to according to 15 USC 1692 ( k ). A law firm can not attempt to collect a debt on be half of the creditor. That's illegal because the states that law firms can not act as debt collectors. I sent a certified noticed to Midland Credit Management on XX/XX/2021 demanding them to cease and desist as well as an invoice for the violation. There are other violations that Midland Credit Management has conducted such as 15 USC 1692 ( i ) in which congress makes it clear that bringing legal action by debt collector is unauthorized and 15 USC 1692a ( 6 ) ( A ) ( C ) ( D ) ( 6 ). The term debt collector means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another. The term does not include - ( A ) any officer or employee of a creditor while, in the name of the creditor, collecting debts for such creditor ; ( C ) any officer or employee of the United States or any State to the extent that collecting or attempting to collect any debt is in the performance of his official duties ; ( D ) any person while serving or attempting to serve legal process on any other person in connection with the judicial enforcement of any debt. I will be invoicing Midland Credit Management for the additional violations conducted against me and sending it certified within 5 business days. Additionally, I do not owe this debt because there is no contract stating that this credit was extended to me by this debt collector. I also demand that this be removed from my consumer reports because I did not give permission to report anything on my consumer report ; it is unauthorized."
Debt collection,XXXX is the collection company handling to collection. They called Tuesday both mine and my husbands phone. My husband returned their call and they discussed the debt and what is was going to take to fix it. My husband is not on the loan or my personal account. I spoke with them Wednesday about the fact that they discussed my personal info with my husband she informed me they are able to. She stated that I woild be served papers today if not paid and then garnishment would start soon after.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I got these negative items from unknown companies to show up on my credit report.
Mortgage,"Originally, green tree servicing llc granted me a {$29000.00} loan for a pool at my residence. In order for me to qualify, the representative of the company inflated my annual income by nearly XXXX %. My income was approximately {$34000.00} per year and to make the loan work, he reported it at $ XXXX as memory serves. I was a single father at the time, stuck in a terrible adjustable rate mortgage, receiving no child support and working XXXX jobs. There was no way I should have been qualified for the loan. Yet Green Tree found a way for XXXX XXXX, who has since gone under, to put a nearly {$30000.00} pool in my now foreclosed on home. 
Since my foreclosure, I have remarried and after being served collection papers from a law firm that Green Tree apparently sold my loan to, I reached a settlement with the law firm to repay half the remaining balance, just over {$14000.00}. They worked with me and put me on a manageable payment plan that was scheduled to be fulfilled in XXXX 2016. However, with tax returns and yearly bonuses my wife and I were able to pay the balance earlier this year and it is my understanding this debt has been satisfied. 
Now I receive a notice in the mail that is a letter informing me that 'Federal and state law prohibit certain methods of debt collection, and require that we treat you fairly. ' This was received from Green Tree Servicing of XXXX, Arizona. This letter not only rekindles the sour taste I have from ever being qualified for a loan they had no business issuing, but also leads me to believe that they still have this loan as an active debt. Frankly I am hesitant to contact these people to find out what is going on because I simply have no trust in them, and I worry they may try to collect further, even after our settlement. 
I decided to write to the CFPB because they provided your website as an avenue to report shady collection practices. I feel everything this company has done has been shady and feel it is my right to inform your offices of my situation."
Mortgage,My mortgage servicing was transferred to Ditech from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I was due a 6th year Hamp incentive in XXXX XXXX of {$5000.00} plus a reamoritzation as part of a law passed last year. I 'm getting nowhere. Ditech has never responded to my numerous requests for this incentive to be applied. I lodged a complaint with XXXX XXXX and now the servicer told them that I was 90 days late XX/XX/XXXX and the treasury denied the incentive. It 's not true. I was given the {$1000.00} all 5 years. I have records to prove I was never 90 days late since my Hamp incentive was finalized in XX/XX/XXXX.
Mortgage,"Mortgage fraud and unfair business practice against Select Portfolio. On XX/XX/XXXX, Select Portfolio sent a letter stating to contact them for Mortgage Assistance and resolution. I contacted Select Portfolio and they stated there's no options available and that the Mortgage issue has been referred to an Attorney for Foreclosure. 

Select Portfolio and XXXX XXXX  has committed Mortgage Fraud. XXXX is still the Lender of my Mortgage loan. Select Portfolio stated they are not the decisoin makers, XXXX XXXX  is the decision maker. This method is very unfair and XXXX is not in compliance in allowing me the opportunity to address my mortgage balance of {$84000.00}. XXXX sold my mortgage as a bond to Select Portfolio for {$240000.00}. My issue is XXXX is doing the same mortgage fraud they were fined by the US Government. XXXX is shielding all responsibility of my mortgage issues through Select Portfolio. 

Please add my name to both the two Class Actions suits against XXXX and Select Portfolio. Select Portfolio refuses to resolve this issue. It is time for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to fine both of these Mortgage Companies. XXXX was given the Bail out money to assist me in the HARP but has failed to do this. I was given a 36 months fixed 1 percent for Military Assistance program since XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX and Select Portfolio is not taking responsiblities for their wrong doing. 

The Georgia State Attorney General advise me to submit a Mortgage fraud suit and to hire an attorney to sue both companies. 

Select Portfolio told me tonight they are not willing to assist me in this matter"
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I recently reviewed my credit report and I found errors on my report from accounts I did not provide my written instruction.

I know these were not opened by me because I was still in high school and didn't know about credit until my recent years. I've spent the past year disputing these accounts as fraudulent and haven't had any response from either creditor. These fraudulent negative accounts are stopping me from proceeding to my next steps in life and are hurting my credit score very bad, I would appreciate any help I could get.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","As you know, Equifax had a major data breach impacting up to 143M consumers. All information needed to ruin someone 's life was stolen. As soon as I learned about this, I took steps to protect myself though Equifax did not tell the public until months after the breach. I went to each of the three major agencies and placed a freeze on my credit and on my husbands ( with his permission ). I had to pay {$7.00} for each freeze resulting in a cost of {$45.00} ( two charges at each bureau ). I do n't feel I should have to pay this since I only did it because of the less than acceptable security Equifax had on their system. Not only that, but I will have to pay each time I need to apply for credit to have the freeze temporarily removed. I did not address this with Equifax because they have no way for a consumer to contact them except by mail. If they do have a way to contact them other than mail, it was not easy to find on their website. I would have to write letters, which is yet another inconvenience for me."

So I called Rent Recovery solutions and taught with a representative and he did some checking on the statement that I had received. He did determine that this was not my debt, I did not owe it, and he would remove it off their system after I file a report with the FTC.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other",This is XXXX XXXX please do not deny my complaint by stating that I filed this by some other means than myself. This is done 100 % by me. The stuff on my credit report is wrong and Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b Permissible purposes of consumer reports I never gave any written consent to report anything on my consumer reports no consent is fraud.
Consumer Loan,"This letter is to raise concern about service I recently received from a Key Bank XXXX branch. I was cold called even though I am on the do not call list on approximately XX/XX/2016 by a Key Bank XXXX employee and was offered a personal loan for credit card consolidation in the amount of $ XXXX My wife and I discussed it for several days and decided to submit the application and speed up our process on becoming debt fee from 10+ years down to 5 years according to the verbal offer made on the phone. On XX/XX/2016 we submitted the application. We were denied the loan even though we met the banks pre-approval criteria. We were then offered a contingent loan if we refinanced our auto loan through them with a lower monthly payment. The existing loan was to be paid off approximately XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX of this year and was at a .9 % interest rate. The wife and I again discussed the options and decided that even though the term would reset the timeline to five years and increase the interest rate to 4.69 % from .9 % interest rate, including loan origination and paperwork fees it would be less than wat we are paying in interest for the credit cards in the long run with the closing of the personal loan that was promised. During the auto loan closing process we were again reassured that everything would be fine and the personal loan would be approved upon the completion of the auto loan. Once we completed the auto loan process our credit was ran for the third time and we then were told the underwriter denied / revoked the original contingent offer even though we met the Banks pre-approval guidelines. At this time our credit had been ran three times affecting our credit score greatly, the Branch manager then offered to close a loan in the amount of {$15000.00} when we returned from a memorial service the following week. We then said ok it 's better than nothing. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to set up the closing the Branch manager then stated we had to wait another 30 days to run credit again when implying on the phone that we would just be modifying the terms with no further credit pulls. At this time I stated they are not going to run my credit for the fourth time and they needed to honor the original contingent offer. The branch manager then stated he would see what he can do. After calling the branch for several days asking for updates finally the Branch manager responded with there is nothing we can do. At this time I feel that several violations have occurred and are as follows but not limited to, do not call list violation, Bait and Switch, False advertising, revocation of a written and verbal agreement altering a financial situation for the worse, and potentially more. In conclusion my wife and I did not go looking for this situation the Bank came to us to help us better our financial situation, however quite the opposite has happened. The bank has greatly altered my financial situation negatively by negatively affecting our credit score and making potently harder for future loans or lines of credit, further raising our percentage rate on the auto loan while also now adding loan origination and paper work fees with prepayment penalties if we pay the loan of early as planned. If we would have allowed the Bank to continue to pull our credit over and over they would have. Furthermore when we raised question as to some of the denial reasons they were then changed to fit the needs of the bank such as insufficient credit file, we have over 20years of credit file, and insufficient liquidity. Liquidity was not even discussed and they have no idea what I have in other banks and retirement institutions.. How can we continue to trust this institution after what has happened with no remedy offered."

Debt collection,"To Whom It May Concern, Subject : Complaint Regarding Structured Settlement / Nationwide Capital Services , LLC I am submitting this complaint regarding a company operating under the name Structured Settlement, also known as Nationwide Capital Services , LLC, with an address at XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. This company is currently reporting a debt of {$1400.00} on all three of my credit reports, claiming that it originated with XXXX XXXX. The manner in which this company is conducting itself raises several serious concerns : XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX Refusal to Validate Debt XXXX XXXX  When I called this company, they refused to provide written validation of the debt, despite my request. Under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ), a consumer has the right to receive verification of the debt, including the original creditors information, an itemized accounting, and proof of their legal authority to collect. They have not provided any of this, and to date, I have not received anything in writing from them. 2. XXXX XXXX Unsafe and Unfair Payment Demands XXXX XXXX During phone conversations, they stated they will not accept payment by cashiers check or money order and will only accept payment if I provide my bank account or debit card information. This practice is unsafe, coercive, and inconsistent with lawful debt collection. I believe this is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to my financial accounts. 3. XXXX XXXX Broken Chain of Title XXXX XXXX  When I contacted the original creditor, Lend Nation, they told me they no longer had the account and that it had been sold to another company. When I contacted that company, they confirmed they no longer owned the account either and that it had been sold again to Nationwide Capital ServicesXXXX XXXX XXXX This broken chain of title raises serious doubts about whether Nationwide Capital Services has any legal standing to collect this debt or report it to the credit bureaus. 4. XXXX XXXX Licensing Concerns XXXX XXXX Although this company represents itself as being licensed, I have not been able to verify any valid Nevada collection agency license for Structured Settlement or Nationwide Capital Services , LLC through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or the National Multistate Licensing System ( NMLS ). Nevada law ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) requires collection agencies to be licensed unless exempt, and I found no evidence of such a license. This raises further concerns about their legal ability to collect debts. 5. * * Consumer Complaints and History * * This company has a record of consumer complaints with the Better Business Bureau, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other review platforms. Many other consumers have reported similar issues : refusal to validate debts, unsafe payment demands, and questionable business practices. -- - # # # Requested Action I respectfully request that your office investigate this companys practices, including their refusal to validate debts, their coercive payment demands, their failure to demonstrate legal ownership of the debt, and their possible lack of a Nevada collection agency license. I further request that any inaccurate or unverified reporting to the credit bureaus be addressed promptly. I am not refusing to pay legitimate debts. My intent is to resolve only valid obligations through safe and lawful means. I simply want to ensure that this company is complying with the law and that my rights under the FDCPA and state law are respected. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am willing to provide further documentation if needed, including copies of my credit reports showing the account, as well as notes from my calls with XXXX XXXX and the subsequent company that previously held the account. These calls have been made on several different dates in XXXX. The latest one was XX/XX/year> XXXX"

Debt collection,This account was unauthorized. I am a victim of identity theft.
Debt collection,"This debt collector engaged in abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices of the FDCPA which it prohibits. They furnished this account that we didn't agree upon and I didn't sign an agreement on. A legal contract is signed by two parties and I did not participate in any of it. More so, they didn't follow the proper procedure in notating my dispute of the account, which is a direct violation of 15 USC 1692e ( 8 ), which makes this unfair practices. According to the FDCPA Im entitled to 1,000 dollars per violation and clearly they violated my rights.

I demand this company to delete this account from all 3 credit reporting agencies and compensate me for the violations or I will have no choice but to forward this to my litigation attorney who has advised me that the fact that they didnt notate my account on my credit report as consumer disputes as a violation that I am able to sue them under."

Mortgage,"To : Valon Mortgage , Inc . 
From : XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Missouri XXXX Date : [ Insert Date ] RE : Formal Rebuttal to CFPB Response CFPB Case # XXXX Loan Number Ending In : XXXX I. FAILURE TO REBUT LEGAL NOTICE AND EVIDENCE Valons response dated XX/XX/XXXX, fails to acknowledge or rebut my attached and properly served NOTICE OF UNCONSCIONABLE CONTRACT. This 5.7 MB affidavit was submitted under penalty of perjury and included sworn allegations of : Title 12 banking violations ( 12 U.S.C. 84, 93a, 371 ) OCC regulation violations ( 12 C.F.R. 7.1004, 215.3 ) Deprivation of rights under color of law ( 42 U.S.C. 1983, 1985 ) Unjust enrichment, fraud, and lack of lawful consideration Valon did not dispute a single point. Silence equals agreement. Valon 's failure to rebut constitutes tacit admission, commercial dishonor, and lawful default.

II. ADMISSION OF NO CASH COLLATERAL DEPOSIT ACCOUNT Valon has admitted in prior correspondence that no cash collateral deposit account exists for the alleged loan. This confirms no lawful extension of credit occurred.

Under federal law : 12 U.S.C. 84 requires lending limits tied to actual capital or surplus.

12 C.F.R. 215.3 ( a ) ( 8 ) requires a legally binding commitment of funds.

Cotton v. PrivateBank, 235 F. Supp. 3d 809 ( N.D. Ill. 2017 ) confirms that claims of credit require proof of asset-based origin.

Federal Reserve operating procedures prohibit securitization and servicing without a valid originating asset.

Valons own admission proves that : No money of account or consideration was lawfully extended.

The transaction is a nullity under Title 12.

There is no standing to collect, foreclose, or report to credit agencies.

III. NO ORIGINAL NOTE = NO STANDING Valon has failed to produce the original, wet-ink promissory note.

Under controlling authority : Carpenter v. Longan, 83 U.S. 271 ( 1872 ) Carlin v. Davis, 332 F. Supp. 3d 876 ( S.D. Tex. 2018 ) UCC Article 3 A photocopy is not evidence of a lawful obligation. Foreclosure without the original note is fraudulent misrepresentation and violates 15 U.S.C. 1692e.

IV. CONDUCT UNDER COLOR OF LAW Valon is attempting foreclosure in XXXX XXXX, Missouri, a non-judicial jurisdiction that offers no constitutional oversight. 

This is a violation of : The 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution Missouri Constitution, Article I 2, 10, and 26 42 U.S.C. 1983 deprivation of rights under color of state law Valon is acting as a private actor under color of law, without lawful authority or a court order, which is a tortious abuse of process.

V. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Valon have : Shared personal financial data without consent, in violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq. ) Violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act Failed to comply with state privacy laws This disclosure is unauthorized and unlawful. You are liable for civil damages and injunctive relief.

VI. CFPB HAS FAILED TO PERFORM ITS STATUTORY DUTY The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has also failed in its obligation to uphold federal law and protect consumer rights.

By forwarding my complaint to a known debt collector who has no lawful standing, the CFPB is aiding and abetting the unlawful collection of a debt.

The CFPB admits that it does not intervene in legal disputes, but it is still bound by : The Administrative Procedure Act The Fair Credit Reporting Act The Dodd-Frank Act ( 12 U.S.C. 5481 et seq. ) CFPB has failed to investigate the underlying illegality of the transaction, including : No cash collateral deposit No original note Unauthorized credit reporting Violations of Title 12 and OCC regulations By refusing to intervene while still facilitating communication between the borrower and the servicer, the CFPB has created a constructive agency relationship and is thereby complicit in the unlawful enforcement of a fabricated debt. This is a breach of public trust.

VII. PROPERTY IS PRIVATE, NOT UNDER FEDERAL FORECLOSURE JURISDICTION This is a private, non-commercial homestead not subject to foreclosure under : Title 12 U.S.C. 371 Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution ( contracts clause ) Missouri Constitution, Article I 2, 10, 26 Federal preemption under Title 12 bars state non-judicial foreclosure, especially when the entity lacks lawful authority to enforce the alleged debt.

VIII. DEMAND FOR INVESTIGATION AND ACTION You are hereby placed on final notice : Cease and desist all foreclosure and collection activity immediately.

Produce all lawful documents demanded, including the original note and proof of consideration.

Respond to all points raised in the attached notice under penalty of perjury. 

Disclose servicing agreements between XXXX XXXX, XXXX Mortgage, and Valon. 

This rebuttal will be submitted to : CFPB ( official feedback ) Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Missouri Attorney General XXXX Attorney for the XXXX XXXX of Missouri Failure to respond will result in legal action for : Fraud Deprivation of rights Unauthorized collection Unauthorized disclosure Unjust enrichment Respectfully submitted, XXXX XXXX"

It was even at XXXX point an automated call saying that all I need to to extent my forbearance was press XXXX on my phone keypad. I did so. 

At the end of XX/XX/XXXX Shellpoint said that I needed to make a payment on XX/XX/XXXX to restart my loan. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and the person I spoke with said I could not make a payment, that they were assessing my account. 

Then I was told that since my loan had been modified just before the forbearance started, I was not eligible for any of the available options. I asked why I was not told this at the time, and was told by the person I spoke with that this information only became available at the end of the forbearance. 

Basically, the forbearance was not available to me without the need to bring ALL payments current at the end of it. 

I was, in my opinion, completely misled as to what was available to me, and now find myself with {$40000.00} in arrears on my mortgage, with foreclosure looming. 

The CARES Act was supposed to protect from demands for all back payments to be made. Why is it not effectively protecting me now?

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Re : Debt Validation & CFPB Complaint Account # XXXX Original Creditor : XXXX Reported Balance : {$2200.00} To Whom It May Concern, I am formally disputing the accuracy and validity of the above-referenced account. This is not a refusal to pay but a lawful request for complete debt validation pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( FDCPA ).

Until you provide full and competent validation, you must immediately cease all collection activities, including but not limited to phone calls, text messages, emails, workplace contact, and reporting to any consumer reporting agency ( FDCPA 805 ( c ) ).

For this account, I demand the following : 1. Assignment contract or full chain of assignment from the original creditor to Midland Credit Management , Inc .

2. Bill of sale from the original creditor with identifying account details.

3. Account-level documentation, including but not limited to the signed contract, monthly statements, and charge-off details. 
4. Proof of licensing and bonding authorizing Midland Credit Management , Inc. to collect in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

5. Full breakdown of the alleged balance, showing principal, interest, fees, and any other charges.

Reporting or attempting to collect on an unvalidated debt violates FDCPA 807 ( 2 ) ( A ), 807 ( 8 ) and FCRA 602 ( A ), 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). If you can not produce the above documentation within the time allowed by law, you must : Immediately remove all information related to this account from all consumer reporting agencies ; Provide written confirmation of deletion ; and Refrain from selling, transferring, or reassigning this account to any other entity. 

This matter is also being filed as a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for investigation. My requested resolution is : Permanent deletion of this account from all credit reports ; Written confirmation of said deletion ; Prohibition against future collection or resale.

Mortgage,"Normally, a buyer in CA inherits the sellers tax basis and a supplemental tax bill that the buyer pays in the first year adjusts the sellers basis to the buyers basis. 

When a buyer takes an impound account for taxes, the originating lender should adjust for the actual basis, not retain the sellers basis ( which is often lower ). 

What Bethpage did, and escrow permitted here, was for us to inherit the sellers SELLERs XXXX basis, which was only {$1000.00} per year ( {$88.00} per month ). This borders on negligence because they all knew our impound account would get slammed with an adjustment at a day in the future. 

So we closed in XXXX of XXXX, for a 7 year fixed loan, with a monthly mortgage price of ~ {$5400.00}. A year and half goes by, and we are blindsided by "" an escrow deficit '' and our new mortgage payment is now ~ {$6800.00}, which was automatically withdrawn in our most recent mortgage payment, introducing financial hardship to my family and I.

Mortgage,"Ocwen my mortgage servicer has made it nearly impossible to get private mortgage insurance removed XX/XX/XXXX-I inquired to have PMI removed since the value of my home has gone up due to the market. I was told over the phone, that I would have to wait 2 years before I could take market appreciation into account on the house, unless I was able to provide receipts and documents of the $ XXXX of improvements i made in the house XX/XX/XXXX-I received a document that stated I had to wait 2 years ( 2 years after the loan origination date ) before I could take market appreciation into account on the house, unless I was able to provide receipts and documents of the $ XXXX of improvements i made in the house. The document laid out the process, and made absolutely no mention of using a single vendor. 

XX/XX/XXXX- I received a document in the mail, stating my rights to cancel PMI, and the 3 stipulations that I had to meet verbatim The LTV ratio must be less than or equal to 80 percent as follows : For purchase transactions, original value is the lesser of the sales price or the appraised value from loan origination. 
For refinance transactions, original value is based on the appraised value from loan origination. 
The borrower must submit a written request to the address below. 
The loan must be current with no payments received 30 or more days late in the preceding 12 months or 60 or more days late in the preceding 24 months. The account must remain current throughout the cancellation process. 
Proof of a type satisfactory to the mortgage investor that the property has not declined in value since loan origination. 
( Please note that any related fees will not be reimbursed by Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC ). 

XX/XX/XXXX- Since my loan origination date was XX/XX/XXXX, I waited to the 2 year mark to get an appraisal done on the house. I got an appraisal done, and register mailed to Ocwen with the written letter to cancel PMI. 

XX/XX/XXXX- After no answer from ocwen or reply, I called customer service to ask what the status was. They said that a realtor estimate was not good enough, and that I would need to get an actual appraisal of the property. 

XX/XX/XXXX-After getting the appraisal, and mailing it to Ocwen registered mail, they said that the appraisal was not done through their single vendor, and the {$460.00} spent on getting the appraisal would be worthless. 

XX/XX/XXXX- After begging and pleading with Ocwen about the appraisal being from a NH State licensed appraisal, Ocwen still denied the appraisal to be used to cancel PMI. After being denied from using a state licensed NH appraiser, I asked which vendor we could use. Customer Service representatives, said "" any vendor '', and then when I brought to an escalation manager none of them could name the actual vendor theyre required to use! Even in both denial letters, they do not state the actual reason that they are denying PMI cancellation. 

This is even after I met all the stipulations to cancel PMI, since it was not done through their single vendor it would not be allowed. This requirement was not mentioned in the contract signed at closing as well as the documents sent to me numerous times after making the inquiry of canceling PMI. This is even after Ocwen was forced to pay XXXX in very similar class action lawsuit, and barred from doing business in both Maine, and Massachusetts. 

Even after potential litigation. Ocwen refuses to honor my appraisal, for absolutely no reason."

Debt collection,"Around the end of XXXX of two years ago ( 2023 ), I found out someone had opened a credit card account with Capital One in my name through XXXX alerting me. I immediately called Capital One and alerted them it was fraudulent and that I wanted it closed. I received no follow up communication until around XXXX, 2023 when they began demanding I pay over {$3000.00} that this credit card had accrued. The account wasn't closed when I asked for it be and Capital One refuses to acknowledge it was fraudulent. I then spent the next year or so arguing with Capital One about this account, they refuse to cooperate and take any fault. 

They have since used 2 separate debt collection agencies to try to collect said debt. The first being XXXX XXXX and the second being XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have asked both to stop contacting me as I have already informed Capital One that I refuse to pay for their mistakes."
Mortgage,"I fell behind on payments a year ago. I actually borrowed money from my mother last XX/XX/XXXX to catch up the payments. But when I contacted Seterus, they advised me that they would be happy to simply roll the payments to the end of the loan not to make a payment at that time, and therefore I would not have to borrow from my family. I did as they suggested. I was denied the modification. I called them to ask why and they said I had already had the max limit of modifications. One occasion they are counting as a modification is  a principal adjustment. I explained to them I had the money to make my payment and bring my account current and they suggested I not make the payment to apply for modification to roll the payment to the end. I asked why they informed me I could roll the payments to the end of the modification. She asked my story. After I explained my situation I was informed to try again. I was denied numerous times and was encouraged to keep trying. 
I was given a sale date of XX/XX/2018. Seterus, Inc. informed me that they removed the date to assist me and wanted me to be involved more, for example call in every day to make sure they have received all paperwork and to make sure they don't need anything else. Seterus, Inc. requested I send the following information : A copy of my husbands license to prove he still resided in the home, check stubs, and another letter stating my terrible situation ( My entire city flooded, XXXX, LA and my little brother passed away shortly after ) and reasons for previous modification. I sent in all requested information they requested the very same day. Seterus, Inc. gave me hope that I would indeed receive the modification. After all, they stopped the sale date for me ( or so I was told ). 
I have once again been served papers notifying me of a Sheriff 's  sale. My new sale date is XX/XX/2018. When I call Seterus, Inc. they tell me they know nothing of a sales date. I have contacted them several times about the date and they still inform me they have no information about a sales date. I give them the date every time I call. As well as not being aware of my sales date Seterus, Inc. now says  there is absolutely nothing they can do to assist me. They can not stop the sales date. The only thing I can do is pay the {$27000.00} to bring the loan payment current. This is unfair. I tried to make a payment back in XX/XX/XXXX. Now I owe {$27000.00} due to late fees and legal fees. Just appears to me this was a set up since XX/XX/XXXX. 
I even called the HOPE Foundation and XXXX XXXX XXXX and they both ran my name and said Seterus, Inc. can indeed roll these payments to the end of my mortgage even with my previous modifications. They told me this back in XX/XX/XXXX. They have encouraged me what to say to Seterus, Inc. the entire time because Seterus refuses to discuss anything with these companies ( even with me present with them giving my permission for them to speak ) because these companies want to record the phone call and Seterus will not talk if the line is being recorded. Seterus informs me they record all messages, but I can't. But due to the fact that Seterus does indeed record all phone calls all my above information can be proven to be fact. And I'm not talking about the notes they take because they never read back all the information from previous phone calls. Please listen to all of the recorded phone calls from the first day I called in. 
One more thing, Seterus, Inc. has my house appraised at {$170000.00}. I owe {$180000.00}. Honestly, I do not believe the house to be worth {$170000.00}."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/year>, I signed a settlement agreement and made an initial payment of {$44.00}. I was told I had until XX/XX/year> to pay the remaining balance. 

However, on XX/XX/year>, an unauthorized XXXX debit of {$360.00} was taken from my account. I did not authorize this withdrawal. 

When I called to resolve the issue, I was transferred multiple times and eventually told that no one could access my account due to a system issue, and that I would need to wait XXXX days before calling back."

I have been waiting for something from Specialized Loan Servicing to take to the lawyer so that the deed can be switched over to my name since I am the executor of my mothers estate. But instead they sent me a stack of new mortgage payment statements. In XXXX they sent a Mortgage Payment Reminder, my wife contacted them but they refused to speak with her regarding this mortgage despite me giving authorization many times to speak to her, since I have to continually take off of work to contact them. Now I am receiving foreclosure statements, I can't understand how a mortgage be in foreclosure when in is paid off. I took off work again on XXXX and contacted them again to let them know that the loan was paid. Now I was notified that to close the loan they wanted more monies to close the loan plus late fees for the 4 months starting in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, but nothing was due so how could I get late charges."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2025, I received a letter from Security Credit Services , LLC regarding an alleged account originally with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Account # XXXX, Security Credit Services Account # XXXX ). 

I dispute this alleged debt in its entirety. In their letter, Security Credit Services stated that they had ceased collection activity and updated the account as Disputed with the credit bureaus. However, they also claimed that the information I previously provided was not sufficient to determine fraud or identity theft and demanded that I send them a government-issued ID, police report, and FTC Identity Theft Affidavit.

Rather than simply asserting identity theft, I exercised my legal rights to request full debt validation and proof of ownership. Specifically, I sent them a written demand under : FDCPA 809 ( b ) Requesting the original executed credit agreement, full GAAP-compliant accounting ledger, Bill of Sale , Assignment Agreements, and any securitization documents if the account had been sold into a trust. 

UCC 9-210 Requesting the full chain of title identifying the Secured Party of Record and all transfers from XXXX XXXX to Security Credit Services . 

TILA 1638 ( a ) & 12 CFR 1026.1720 Requesting original Truth in Lending disclosures, payoff statements, and transfer notices.

GLBA 502 Requesting their privacy policy and disclosures of any sale, transfer, or securitization of my personal financial data.

To date, Security Credit Services has failed to provide any of the legally required documents proving ownership, chain of title, or accurate accounting. Without this information, they have no legal standing to collect or continue reporting the account to credit bureaus.

By continuing to report or attempting to collect without proper validation, they are violating : FDCPA 807, 809 ( b ) False representation of the debt and failure to validate.

FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) & 623 ( b ) Failure to update account status and conduct a reasonable investigation. 

TILA 1638 ( a ) & Reg Z Failure to provide material disclosures.

GLBA 502 Unauthorized transfer and use of my personal financial data.

UCC 9-210 Failure to identify the secured party of record and provide an accounting.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I have had an active Kohls credit card for years. I have used it and typically pay the balance in full. Over the years I have missed payments because I forgot to pay before the deadline or missed the statement ( in my defense Kohls sends so many emails ). In the past I have paid a late fee or interest but nothing had ever been reported a credit agency. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase using my Kohls credit in the amount of {$1.00}. This was first recorded on the XXXX statement with a due date on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not see the statement and it was again reported on the XXXX statement with a due date on XX/XX/XXXX. I again did not see the statement. I received an email of a missed payment on XX/XX/XXXX and promptly paid the balance. 

At the beginning of XXXX I pulled a credit report and my scores dropped by almost XXXX points and upon inspection it was because Kohls reported a delinquent balance. I acknowledge the payment was delinquent. But, I am confused why they decided to report that one and not prior missed payments. This is not the first time I have been two months late, but its the first time the balance was so low that they were unable to charge the {$25.00} late fee or significant interest. I assumed that based on our course of business there would be no further issues. However, I was wrong because they couldnt extract more money from me. In my opinion that is a predatory practice. 

I called Kohls and attempt to resolve the issue. The customer service agents were limited in their ability to do anything other than submit a request. I received a letter in a couple of weeks but all it said was there were no errors. I still am trying to figure out why they report items inconsistently. I agree that accurate reporting is necessary under our credit system. However, transparency and information asymmetries are also huge issues. Creditors should not be able to inconsistently report delinquent payments during the course of a relationship. Kohls coerces people into using the their proprietary credit card to access coupons or discounts. Baits consumers by providing leniency when they can extract fees or interest but then slams users when they can not. There is no worse feeling than having your credit wrecked over {$1.00}."

There after the call ended with a payment due on the XXXX of every month. Around the XXXX of the month, I made a {$50.00} payment through my online banking, they received it XXXX XXXX, 2015.

I told her that I could not afford {$100.00} monthly that is why I sent {$50.00}. She was extremely rude. About XXXX minutes after that call, I called back, she answered and I asked to speak with her supervisor. I got a voicemail of a male. I could not hear his name because it was n't clear enough. I left a message. Moments later, I wrote a letter to the company about my experience with their rude employee. I then faxed it and sent a copy by certified mail. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I called back looking for the supervisor but was unsuccessful. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received what I call a threatening letter from the company which had no signature. On XXXX XXXX, I received {$50.00} from a friend to pay to make another payment because I did not want them to put a lien on my checking account like I was told they could do. My bank showed a payment date of XXXX XXXX, 2015, so I called the company XXXX XXXX to confirm the payment. The young man said he did not see a payment posted. I then called my bank and it was stated that they mailed the company the check on XXXX XXXX. I called the company back and told them that they should have received the check. The young lady told me they did not receive it and that they do n't control the mail. I told the young lady I believed someone was playing games and to post my check. Words were exchanged. I told her that I sent a fax. She said "" We did n't receive a fax. '' I told her that I also sent a letter. She said in a concerning way, "" You sent a letter? '' I said "" Yep '' she asked "" What was in it? '' I told her if my check was n't found soon, I would be obtaining a lawyer. she said "" That 's your prerogative.

It indicated that the new servicer was Nationstar Mortgage LLC dba/ Mr. Cooper XXXX This came as a shock as we had barely received our first statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and no explanation as to why it was changing. The first week of XXXX we received a Notice of Servicing Transfer along with the welcome letter which included the payment stub to pay the first amount due XX/XX/XXXX in the the amount of {$2600.00}. My husband ( XXXX XXXX ) and I immediately called Mr Cooper informing them to add me ( XXXX XXXX ) as a XXXX party to access account information.

On XX/XX/XXXX, Mr Cooper had still not received our HomeOwners Insurance information which I was told would automatically happen when the loan was transferred but that did not happen. We had to contact our insurance department and prove the insurance coverage and ensure that it was included in the loan. After 1 week of trying to figure all that out we finally received a mail in the letter showing the insurance coverage was added.

Despite this full payoff, XXXX XXXX reported to Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian that foreclosure proceedings were initiated after the loan was satisfied.

I have disputed this directly with the credit bureaus and XXXX multiple times, submitted supporting documentation, and even filed FTC identity theft and fraud reports. The bureaus responses were dispute resolved subscriber disagrees, leaving the false foreclosure reporting intact. 

Citadels actions have caused me serious financial harm : I have been denied credit, charged higher insurance premiums, and forced to accept auto loan interest rates as high as 18 % despite proof that the foreclosure reporting is false.

I tried contacting equifax but was unable to get through to a live representative due to their ridiculous automated system so I decided to leave it alone, figured it wasnt causing that big of problem since i Could still view my score on Equifax website. However it is now the end of XX/XX/2021 and i tried to request a credit limit increase on my XXXX XXXX card which was supposed to have automatic increase but wasn't for some reason and its was declined stating credit bureau information is missing or unavailable. I spoke to XXXX XXXX representative on XXXX XXXX who informed me the problem was on Equifax side and thats who I needed to contact. I contacted Equifax the same day and after multiple attempts I finally got through to a representative. The rep informed me there was no freeze or lock on my account which i already knew because i never placed one. He then said there did seem to be a fraud alert and he would transfer me to another department to have it removed. The next rep said the fraud alert would not prevent any creditor from pulling my credit report but he had removed the alert. I told him if that was not the issue then i needed the root cause to be found because i need my bank to be able to pull my credit report and this issue was affecting my credit limits and in turn going to affect my credit score. He verified my personal information was correct and stated there was nothing else he could do all I could do was wait. I requested to speak to someone in the IT department hoping they would be able to find some type of issue and solve it and he refused to let me speak to them stating they dont take incoming calls. I then requested for him to escalate my account to the IT department then and let them know what was going on so the issue could be fixed and he refused stating Equifax could do nothing else. I asked to speak to a supervisor and after him also refusing to help me any further i asked for his employee ID information to submit a complaint and he hung up in my face. Being that 2 different credit companies are tell me that they are unable to retrieve my Equifax data then there must be a problem on Equifax side that they are refusing to look into or solve. I can not raise my credit score without creditors being able to access my credit report and need this resolved asap. After a quick XXXX search i found multiple articles of people with the same problem with Equifax so I dont know why Equifax is acting like it is unheard of. It is currently XX/XX/XXXX, and i am still having the same issues with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX being able to access my information."
Debt collection,"Description of the Issue : XXXX XXXX  has charged me {$2900.00}, of which {$2500.00} is disputed. My original lease was a fixed-term contract from XX/XX/XXXX, and scheduled to end on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the company unilaterally extended my lease to XX/XX/XXXX, and subsequently charged me additional fees that I believe are both unjustified and unlawful. 

The disputed amount includes the following : {$1600.00} : XXXX months rent from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which should not be charged since my lease ended XX/XX/XXXX. 
{$100.00} : Short-term lease fee {$320.00} : Late fee {$120.00} : Court filing fee {$370.00} : Painting fee Total disputed amount : {$2500.00} XXXX attempted to pay the undisputed amount by money order, which my colleague, ( XXXX XXXX deliver it to them on XX/XX/XXXX, and we record the video as proof ) which was received by XXXX. However, they did not deduct this payment from my outstanding balance. I also paid a {$250.00} security deposit. 
After all adjustments, the remaining undisputed balance should be {$63.00}. 

Reason for Dispute : XXXX claims that I failed to give a XXXX written notice before the end of my lease, and that I only notified them orally on XX/XX/XXXX. However, this is inaccurate. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I clearly informed them in writing via email that my employment contract runs from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and that I will certainly move out by XX/XX/XXXX, the end of my lease. In the call, I asked XXXX, how much I need to pay for extend XXXX to XXXX days. They literally, telling me it's {$100.00} per day. This email served as written notice more than 60 days prior to the lease end date. Because I was literally telling them this is a temporary job, and I don't have income after XX/XX/XXXX. They accepted my application means they knew the contract is short term. Therefore, their claim that I failed to provide adequate notice is unfounded. 

Additionally, the lease was a fixed-term contract from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX, not a month-to-month agreement. There is no basis for automatic renewal unless mutually agreed upon. As such, the charges related to XXXX rent and associated penalties are improper. 

I have made multiple efforts to resolve this matter directly, but XXXX has not provided sufficient justification for these charges."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/2024 escrow shortage of {$680.00}, increased monthly payment. This has never happened before in the 12 years I have owned my home. This happens many times with my new lender, Mr Cooper. 

XX/XX/2024 Escrow shortage again almost {$600.00}, increased payment, never sent a notice or email but they responded that they did. 

This is happening to many people with this particular lender."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX was serviced by XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX # XXXX ). The loan was on an ACH. 
Loan was transferred to Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing on the day my payment was due and shows as "" paid off '' on that date. New loan number is XXXX. 
My ACH was turned off and I was not notified appropriately. I have ACH in place as a "" set it and forget it '' mechanism to make sure my payments are on time and in the correct amount. I consider the turning off of my ACH on the day the payment was to set to process ( XXXX, XX/XX/24 ) to be a XXXX issue. My loan went delinquent and I now have a {$120.00} late fee, and I am sure this is impacting my credit."

- Require the company in question to provide a detailed and substantiated response. 
- Assist in facilitating a correction of the inaccurate information or resolution of the dispute.

Debt collection,"naccurate Reporting and Improper Collection Activity Resurgent/LVNV Funding & XXXX XXXX Summary of Complaint : I am disputing inaccurate credit reporting by Resurgent/LVNV Funding on my XXXX  credit report. This same account has already been removed by XXXX  and XXXX  for the same inaccuracies. The disputed debt originates from my prior credit card account with XXXX XXXX ( Account XXXX XXXXXXXX ). 

Background : On XX/XX/XXXX, I reported my XXXXXXXX XXXX card stolen. 

At the time of closure, my balance was {$0.00}, confirmed in writing by XXXX XXXX ( see attached affidavit and letter ). 

Despite this, the account remained open until XX/XX/XXXX, and fraudulent charges were not credited until XX/XX/XXXX. 

I made timely payments for all legitimate charges. Any late penalties were tied to fraudulent amounts from which I was later exonerated. 

XXXX reporting shows XXXX and XXXX late payments for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which are factually inaccurate. 

The account should be reported as : Closed at consumers request Paid in full XXXX late payments Resurgent/LVNV Funding Account ( Account # XXXX ) : Lists a {$280.00} balance as of XX/XX/XXXX, opened in XX/XX/XXXX, marked as a collection account. 

This debt is invalidit is directly tied to the same fraudulent charges already credited back by XXXX XXXX. 

The continued reporting of this debt violates : FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692e Prohibiting false, deceptive, or misleading representation of the character, amount, or legal status of a debt.

FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 Prohibiting the reporting of information known or believed to be inaccurate. 

Santanders Response to My Prior Complaint : When I initially disputed this directly, Resurgent/LVNV Funding stated they would only consult with my attorney. While they may prefer that channel, a CFPB complaint is a consumer-initiated process and does not require me to act through legal counsel. Their refusal to address the merits of my dispute here shows a lack of transparency and good faith in consumer reporting. 

Requested Resolution : Immediate removal of the Resurgent/LVNV Funding account from my XXXX  report XXXX 

Correction of the XXXXXXXX XXXX  account to accurately reflect closure at my request, paid in full, with XXXX late payments. 

Written confirmation that these corrections have been made. 

Supporting Documentation : Affidavit and letter from XXXX XXXX confirming {$0.00} balance at closure. 

Correspondence showing the card was reported stolen on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Proof of fraudulent charge credits on XX/XX/XXXX.

Debt collection,"To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a formal complaint against Rubin & Rothman , LLC, regarding their alleged unfair and unlawful collection practices, as well as potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. This complaint specifically addresses Rubin & Rothman, LLCs ( the collector ) attempts to collect on a debt purportedly owed to XXXX XXXX, and XXXX alleged issuance of a 1099-C form to the IRS without notifying me. 

1. Failure to Provide 1099-C Notification : XXXX XXXX . appears to have filed a 1099-C form with the IRS in relation to this debt. Under IRS rules, creditors who issue a 1099-C form must provide the debtor with a copy. However, I never received such notice, leaving me unaware of any potential cancellation of debt income reported to the IRS. This oversight may affect the legal status of the alleged debt and my credit report, which under the FCRA must accurately reflect all pertinent information related to a debt. 
2. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Rubin & Rothman, LLCs actions may be in violation of the FCRA, specifically : Inaccurate Reporting of Debt : The FCRA mandates that credit information must be accurate and complete ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Due to XXXX apparent filing of a 1099-C, Rubin & Rothman , LLC may be reporting a debt that has been discharged or forgiven, leading to a potentially inaccurate credit report entry. 
Failure to Provide Debt Validation : Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), I am entitled to a validation of the debt. However, despite my request, Rubin & Rothman , LLC has failed to provide me with a debt validation letter, creating further uncertainty about the legitimacy of this debt. 
3. Improper Venue and Lack of Jurisdiction to Sue in New York : Rubin & Rothman , LLC has filed a lawsuit against me in the state of New York, despite the fact that I am a resident of Ohio. This filing is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692i, which requires debt collectors to bring legal action either in the district where the consumer resides or where the contract was signed. Since I do not reside in New York and did not sign the contract in New York, this lawsuit constitutes an improper venue and is thus unlawful. 
4. Lack of Authorization to Collect in New York : Rubin & Rothman , LLC has yet to provide evidence of their authorization to collect this debt in New York, where they have initiated litigation. Under the FDCPA, debt collectors are required to prove their authority to collect, especially when jurisdiction is in question. I request that they produce documentation establishing their right to pursue this debt collection in New York, in compliance with applicable state laws."

Debt collection,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally submit a complaint regarding a debt claim reported by Trellis Company, which I believe violates my constitutional rights and has caused me undue harm. According to Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, "" No State shall ... make anything but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts. '' Based on this provision, I assert that any demand for payment not involving lawful gold or silver coin is constitutionally questionable. Furthermore, any alleged debt must be properly validated through a sworn affidavit under penalty of perjury, clearly establishing the debts legitimacy, its origin, and the identity of the original creditor. 

Despite these constitutional requirements, I was subjected to collection efforts and credit reporting by Trellis Company without ever receiving proper sworn validation. Although I submitted a formal request for verification of the alleged debt, no sworn affidavit or legal affirmation under penalty of perjury was provided in response. I consider this a direct violation of my rights and a contributing source of significant financial and reputational harm. 

I also reference XXXX XXXX XXXX, signed during the Trump administration, which states that the U.S. financial system should promote adherence to the Constitution and uphold standards of transparency and accountability. It is my view that Trellis Company 's conduct runs contrary to these principles and requires immediate oversight and redress. 

In light of the above, I respectfully request the following : That all records and account information related to Trellis Company be fully investigated and that any debt not validated by sworn affidavit be deemed invalid and uncollectible. 

That all negative credit report entries associated with Trellis Company be removed, along with entries from XXXX XXXX, with whom I am presently involved in a fraud caseCase No. XXXX well as any other inaccurately or improperly reported accounts. 

That the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau pursue appropriate enforcement or remedial actions to ensure full compliance with constitutional protections, proper debt validation procedures, and responsible credit reporting standards. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter."

I submitted what I could and more more documents were requested. I had to pay my accountant for some of the paperwork so I was already putting out money for something I did not receive anything back from. Global Equity Finance had already added themselves to my homeowners insurance policy causing my current mortgage company to not have access to the bill to pay it. Why would they add themselves to my policy if they did not approve my loan. Trying to XXXX up my credit is the only reason I can see for why they did that. If they still needed paperwork why were they proceeding as if the closing documents have been signed. Underwriting wanted XXXX taxes on business and personal which were not filed yet because of the pandemic. XXXX stated that the XX/XX/XXXX tax deadline had passed and it was a new requirement. We had not finished the old application so why are we using new requirements XX/XX/XXXX I explained to XXXX my application was not new and since we were in the process long before the new rules we should be proceeding as planned especially since they were adding themselves to my home owner 's policy as if they were my new mortgage company XX/XX/XXXX XXXX replied with a bunch of XXXX. I had paid {$490.00} for an appraisal which I was told I would get a copy of and never received. Therefore ; I could not take it to a new mortgage company and if I had applied with anyone else I would have had to start this process over and also get another appraisal and pay more money they acted as if I was approved but treated me as if I wasn't at the same time.

Why did he even match me up with that particular bank. The underwriters couldn't do simple addition and subtraction. I had received a loan from the XXXX in XXXX and big surprise I used it on business bills. 
I paid for an appraisal. They buried me in paperwork. I consider this a scam. 
XX/XX/XXXX I set via regular mail a letter requesting the money back from the appraisal.

XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a XXXX  complaint. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  sent a copy of the complaint to the company. 
XX/XX/XXXX The company wrote the XXXX  that XXXX XXXX has not worked for their company for some time. I replied the same day that this should not matter as they should have assigned someone else to my account and that does not mean they should not refund me for the appraisal. 
XX/XX/XXXX They now want to end me a copy of an appraisal that is over XXXX XXXX XXXX. The appraisal no longer is valid.

All I hear from them is either your loan is under review please call back in 3-6 weeks or youre currently not in any loss mitigation program, your home is at risk for foreclosure and we need to set you up on a program.

This never happened. The deferment went through against my explicit instructions and against Mr . XXXX  written word that it was stopped. 

At this time, I just dont have the mental energy or wherewithal to deal with the deferment issue.

Debt collection,"Dear CFPB, SEQUIUM ASSET SOLUTIONS/ XXXX  XXXX  ; I am filing a complaint regarding a debt collection account that appears on my credit report without my knowledge or consent. I have no relationship with the company reporting this debt and was never notified or contracted with the original creditor.

Under my rights granted by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), I have demanded full validation of the debt, including : * A signed contract or agreement bearing my signature * A full itemized accounting of the debt * Proof of legal assignment or ownership * The Forward Flow Agreement showing what documents were transferred * Proof of the collectors license to collect in my state If these can not be provided, the debt is unverifiable and must be deleted. Continuing to report an unverified, disputed debt violates FCRA 1681e ( b ), 1681s-2 ( b ) and may result in liability under FCRA 1681n and FDCPA 1692k.

Mortgage,"I am the Realtor working with a Buyer who was securing financing with the Keypoint Mortgage. During the transaction, on or around XX/XX/XXXX - The buyer was initially supposed to have 1 months mortgage payment escrow, which changed significantly to 3 months mortgage payments in escrow. Though the buyer had funds in their account, buyer 's assets couldn't be sourced/verified. The loan officer advised that the additional closing costs can be paid outside of settlement directly to the Seller. I advised that this was illegal, to which the loan officer said it was not. 

On or Around XX/XX/XXXX, the same loan officer called me directly to tell me he had a buyer referral. The buyer was to pay in cash and the loan officer asked me how he could benefit from the transaction. He asked how he could make money "" on the side ''. I advised that it was illegal to pay a referral fee to anyone outside of a Real Estate brokerage, to which he replied that it wasn't and people do it all the time. I insisted I wasn't the right agent for him. 

The loan officer continued to update the Listing agent ( with incorrect info ) instead of the Buyer ( the client ) or the Buyers agent ( me ), causing confusion and hindering my ability to negotiate effectively for the Buyer. 

The loan officer displayed misogynistic behavior and speech when talking to the Listing Agent about women in the workplace/field. As well a speaking derogatorily about his younger coworkers while was on a call with him. 

The loan officer was harsh and disrespectful towards our support staff and made her feel very uncomfortable. 

The entire transaction was chaotic, unprofessional and would have been illegal had I not spoken up. 

Buyer asked to lock their rate, to which the Loan Officer advised him against it. ( I was on that call and heard the agent refuse to lock it ) Later in the transaction, he locked a rate that was only good for 15 days, and much higher than the earlier rate, forcing the buyer to pay points and causing unnecessary stress to close quickly. 

The Buyer ultimately lost the home due to poor communication on the Lenders part and lack of trust the Sellers developed towards the Lender. ( The Sellers would not extend the closing date )"

Mortgage,"I started my mortgage refinance application on XX/XX/XXXX. At the time, I was working with Ms. XXXX XXXX. We had multiple email correspondence after which we had a phone conversation to determine elements of the loan. One of those elements was the waiver of the XXXX XXXX higher rate as the original loan was serviced outside of Navy Federal Credit Union. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my loan application was forwarded to XXXX XXXX. We exchanged multiple emails regarding the loan and other additional elements that were required to support the loan. 

An appraisal of the home was done in early XXXX and Ms. XXXX let me know what it was. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to Ms. XXXX with questions about how my new appraised rate of XXXX would change the terms of the loan ( my previously estimated rate of the home was XXXX XXXX. Her response at the time was the there would be no change in the rate as the LTV would remain under XXXX XXXX 

I did not hear much from Ms. XXXX in XXXX so I presumed she was still working on the loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new loan estimate from Ms. XXXX with a new rate of XXXX XXXX. Rate throughout XXXX and XXXX had been locked at XXXX XXXX with a XXXX XXXX  origination fee. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Navy Federal to get clarification on why the loan terms suddenly changed and I spoke with XXXX ( Ms. XXXX was out of the office at the time ). XXXX let me know that someone would be reaching out to me to discuss the change in loan terms. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Ms. XXXX sent me an email stating that the rate changed because the LTV had gone over XXXX XXXX ( contradicting what she had said on XX/XX/XXXX as noted above ). I asked to have my loan escalated to a supervisor given that I was receiving alot of contradictory information from Ms. XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with Ms. XXXX XXXX who is Ms. XXXX 's supervisor. I detailed what had transpired with my loan since the start and she asked for supporting information which I sent to her via email on XX/XX/XXXX. On that email, I also requested to file a grievance on my loan application process and asked for a re-reviewed and if need be, escalation of my loan for further review. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Ms. XXXX indicating that the 0.75 % rate increase had been waived and she had sent a new loan estimate. However, she had once again changed the terms of the estimate and now she was sending me an estimate for a loan amount of XXXX XXXX original loan amount was XXXX XXXX. Due to a busy work schedule, I had not had time to look at the new loan estimate. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Ms. XXXX worded as quoted, "" Please respond by XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX CST in order to move forward. If I do not hear from you I will send the application for decision as is. '' I responded back to the email with a copy to Ms. XXXX requesting for Ms. XXXX to be removed as my loan processor. I received a call from Ms. XXXX on the same day while at work and I indicated that I felt that the email that had been sent my Ms. XXXX was rude. I also indicated that I did not understand why the loan terms changed again. Ms. XXXX noted that she would have Ms. XXXX resend a revised loan estimate with the terms agreed upon. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another loan estimate from Ms. XXXX. Once again, the loan terms had changed. Now the origination fee had been increased from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to Ms. XXXX asking why this had changed. She responded noting, "" The origination fee is subject to change when the loan amount changes, value changes, etc. '' I asked for clarification regarding what had changed on the loan between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX but did not receive a response from Ms. XXXX. Instead, I received an email from Ms. XXXX noting, "" XXXX sent another Loan Estimate to you just a few minutes ago with the XXXX  loan amount and a rate with a XXXX origination fee. '' and a deadline to have a decision made within XXXX hours of that estimate being sent. When I got home from work to review the new loan estimate, once again rate had changed to XXXX XXXX. In review of my file, it had already been sent to underwriting without my consent. 

I feel that since the beginning of XXXX, there have been too many changes to the rates despite the loan having a locked rate."

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","On XX/XX/2020 and during the COVID period I have called my mortgage bank ( Wells Fargo ) For Forebarence plan and I got approved by them by phone to defer my mortgage payments at a later date, but after a month and a half I received a notice to take care of a past due mortgage payment which got me way surprised that I already had requested for the forbearance plan and called the bank to find out what happend and they had nothing in their record showing that the plan was established and they have already reported a late payment to the credit Bureaus without even any communications and any notices and I tried to explain them exactly of what happend and the fact that it wasnt my fault and in the history of my payments for 8 yrs I didnt have even 1 single late payment but they refused to help me. What they did to my report was very unethical and irresponsible. 
I dont even know that during the COVID, would they be allowed to report u for a late payment or not. In general I feel very very disappointed that the bank doesnt want to take any responsibility for their mistake not performing their job right and considering the whole situation as a good faith ground to delet the late payment from my report. Im really so sad because Im also trying to do a refinancing on my home and this one report is a big obstacle on my way of doing so. 
I really would like to ask for ur help to resolve this issue ASAP pls."

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/year> I was contact by XXXX and XXXX. I was called from XXXX and was told to call XXXX. I connected to a company in California. I asked for a North Carolina XXXX license number or a BAR number as they said they work for a law firm. They refused me the information and told me it was BAR XXXX. 

They said they are going serve me with papers and will XXXX  my home for a Citi Bank debt form the years XXXX. They provided me case XXXX XXXXXXXX.

I now live in NC. I never had a debt with Citi Bank and I never banked with Citi Bank, I never signed anything with Citi Bank. I believe this collection effort is illegal and I want the company to be held accountable for unethical practices and illegal collections."
Debt collection,"I contacted Jefferson Capital, I'm trying to pay off and on a debt. I was given an option to submit a "" one time payment '', if I couldn't pay the above options and others. My account on the website allowed me to submit a lesser amount. I contacted Jefferson Capital to verify the option and they would not answer or confirm the accuracy of that option however it was offered to settle the debt with my own personal offer. The agent insisted I choose the other options ( higher amounts ). The agent was trying to justify and explain but he wasn't making any sense of the option. I felt he was trying to confuse me and con me into paying the other higher amounts. I told the agent I would call back, moments later, Jefferson Capitol locked me out of my account and the message said "" my account in ineligible for web service '', only calling was an option. This is deceptive and unfair, now they are not allowing me to log in and view my account to make a payment. They do not want me choosing the lesser amount option and I feel they may alter my account. 

I took screen shots of my account and the options."

Debt collection,"I am filing this complaint because XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) has refused to work with me during a documented financial hardship and continues to demand full payment before offering any assistance. Despite multiple written requests, they have not addressed my hardship or provided any reasonable payment plan or deferment options. 

Details : I currently have an auto loan with XXXX. 
My vehicle is inoperable due to serious engine problems caused by a defect that is the dealerships fault. This issue has prevented me from working my second job, which I rely on to cover my expenses. 
I am a single parent, and my primary income must cover rent, utilities, and basic living expenses. 
I have been making partial payments to show good faith. Recently, I set up automatic payments of {$20.00} and also made an additional {$50.00} payment today toward the past-due balance of {$230.00}. 
Communication Attempts : On XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I emailed XXXX Loss Prevention explaining my hardship and requesting either : A temporary hardship payment plan, or A short-term payment extension/deferment. 
I provided details of my situation, offered to continue making partial payments, and asked for confirmation in writing. 
XXXX responded only with a generic message asking me to contact them but did not address my request for assistance. 
I replied again, reiterating my situation, but they have not provided any plan or flexibility. 
My Concern : XXXX is refusing to acknowledge my hardship and is demanding full payment before offering any form of assistance. This approach ignores my documented communication and ongoing payments. It also puts me at risk of losing my vehicle, which I need to return to work at full capacity."

Midland credit has not provided a original contract like I asked."

I was give a no cause to vacate notice and I paid my rent to this company. Myself and my wife have been bullied and traumatized by this apartment community. They are also very XXXX against myself and my wife. Please have them remove these false charges off our credit. Our day of departure from this company 's apartment was XX/XX/2021 we had to be out by XXXX. We submitted our last payment for the month of XXXX XXXX. This company fraudulently putting eviction on my name and i have the documets that says otherwise. Also getting my {$300.00} deposit back.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Equifax irresponsibly stored and lost my personal information such as my SSN, name, address, etc. Equifax lacked any substantial or modern security within their systems and stored data in an insecure location. My personal information will now circulate throughout sources on the internet for the rest of my life. Equifax has not provided me suitable protection for such a data leak, with only a single year of free fraud alert services. Data like a SSN can never be changed, making a single year of protection almost completely useless. Comprehensive fraud alert services cost at least {$20.00} a month. Going forward, I would have to invest tens of thousands of dollars for simple basic alert protection over the course of my life due to this breach."
Debt collection,Eos cca took down the wrong bank account and or routing number for payments that I agreed to pay to XXXX XXXX. It was their mistake and when they said the payment didnt go through they reported it to the credit agency. They did not offer me the option to use a debit or credit card in the times they contacted me. They probably didnt want to pay the fees. As of XXXX21 XXXX XXXX is showing a zero 0 balance on this account yet they called me today and said I owe both payments. I understand that it can take up to 30 days for bank payments to clear. A payment was arranged for XXXX21 was my recollection. Eos cca called me again on XXXX-21. My bank XXXX show no returned checks to cca eos. The approximate amounts were {$310.00} each ie 2 payments on or about XXXX-21 and or XXXX21. This company also tried to get a higher settlement payment from me at first. It was only after they had the wrong account number and or routing number that they took down erroneously from me that they offered me a lower settlement amount. When the first payment didnt go through due to their error I disputed it with a credit bureau as the mistake was theirs not mine. Their repeated phone calls for their mistakes are harassment. XXXX XXXX  is showing the account paid off as of XXXX-21 and my bank shows no returned checks to eos cca.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Equifax and XXXX knowingly and without lawful authority, and/or expressed written and verbal consent by me, fraudulently took my likeness and personal, non-public, private information to assemble a consumer report that falsely reflects who I am and produced an identification document with authentication feature or false identification document intended to identify me as an individual. Thus, my privacy is being violated in multiple ways to the detriment of my good name. This false reporting is not benefitting me nor is it fair or equitable to me as a consumer. I demand that it is removed from my public profile immediately as the information is a result of aggravated identity theft and the fraudulent use of my personally identifying information, including my name, SSN and financial information without permission from me for the use of personal financial gain and to commit fraud and/or other crimes is strictly prohibited and unlawful."

I have complained. The problem has not been resolved. my fico has me at a credit score over 719XXXX has me at a score around 590. That is a huge difference. XXXX paints me as a XXXX. my fico say I have good credit. What the heck is going on here. i have almost no debt and my identity was stolen causing my score to drop n i made this clear for 60 days straight with XXXX  i spoke to a representative agent name XXXX and XXXX and XXXX from the fraud department I prefer to speak to a us rept but they refused they had me on mute for 4 hours which was hurtful I have a perfect repayment record. I have very low credit utilization. I have three negative credit items outstanding debt now. I have modest but ok income. Social Security. Something is wrong with XXXX. I do not understand why they are abusing consumers .This was a fist step towards attempting resolution. They kept lying telling me they disputed n its not reporting but it keep reporting this inaccurate information without my authorization. They refused or were unable to verify n remove the inquiries and its been 60days n they record the calls n admitted they had my police report n ftc and affidavit That was after attempting to contact XXXX more than 21 times. XXXX is an abusive company. They are supposed to be protecting consumers. They need to be reigned in. they are causing me severe XXXX and stopping me from getting this job offer n now im XXXX  n cant provide to my XXXX year old daughter PLEASE HELP ME PLEASE im XXXX  now.with no help.
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/year>XXXX  out of state Attorney, XXXX XXXX sent me a letter forcing me to sign a contract she isn't approved to offer me. She ends the letter by threatening that Wells fargo will proceed with the forclosure ( I was never served a summons or complaint for ) if I don't return the agreement to her within 21 days ( which had passed already by the time I got it at my correct address )."
Debt collection,"They keep calling me but wont say who they are looking for or why. 
I mentioned my name and they say oh and hang up. 

I asked if they were a debit collector they said we cant say. I thought by law they had to say they where and why they were calling. 

I called twice asking them to stop calling and the last time the girl picked up the phone said "" stop lying '' and hung up on me If you keep calling and I keep telling you that you have the wrong number you think you would look else where. OR OR at least say who you are looking for. I dont know if its a family member, or just the wrong number because they wont say a single thing."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I disputed sum items that I proved was fraudulent and the credit bureau removed the items and put them back on my report after 30 days. My rights are being violated.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Choose according to account type. These can be combined I am very concerned about the items that are being shown on my credit report. Not only are they inaccurate, they are also unjust, because they should not be reporting on my credit report! I ask that you delete these accounts, or I will be filing a legal complaint against you!"
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",XXXX XXXX put a hard inquiry on my credit. I havent had my credit ran since I filed bankruptcy. It was put on there XX/XX/2018. I dont know nothing about this company at all
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX Foster and Monroe was contacted in reference to this debt. I spoke with a gentleman named XXXX XXXX. He stated that the amount owed was {$13000.00} however with interest added the amount added up to {$37000.00} which dated back to XX/XX/XXXX. As of today I have not received any correspondence from the company. 
According to the FDCP act the company has not validated this debt, the account is well beyond the statute of limitations, they have re-aged the account and they have added a substantial amount of interest on the original debt which was originally {$13000.00} but now its {$37000.00}. There should be paperwork provided with what they are stating instead of a verbal response or written response to validate this. It is unfair for companies like this to abuse consumers let alone someone who served their country. This debt should be deleted immediately. This is an illegal tactic that collection agencies use. When this was purchased, the collection agency can not re-age the account to restart the clock. 
After filing one complaint the company responded on XX/XX/XXXX, stating that I had made no attempts to contact them. This is false information due to the fact that I have definitive proof that they were contacted. I am forwarding a letter to the State Attorney General and will be contacting the Federal Trade Commission as well."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( XXXX ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",This account is not mine and I do not want to see this account in my credit report! Could you please remove it as soon as possible because its not mine.

Debt collection,"I resided at XXXX XXXX for an entire year XXXX to XXXX. On XXXX XXXX I provided a check for the full amount of my rent as always, however I forgot to write the name of the apartment complex on the line. I received a call to come write the name of the check via email, so I responded by calling one of the property manager ( XXXX XXXX ). She advised me that it was no big they could write the name in for me due to my son and aunt being in the hospital. Well hours after speaking to her I received another email from a different property manager ( XXXX XXXX ) stating that I need to come write the name in and bring late charges because it was not the XXXX of XXXX. I responded and informed her that the other property manager stated that this issue was resolved and there was no issue with anyone writing the name of the apartment on the check. She then stated that she would write the name on the check, however I should come in at my leisure and submit all applicable late charges. In return responded and informed her, I have never been a problem, nor had I ever been late. so why was she making this simple mistake such a big deal with no substantial merit. She did n't respond! So I sent several emails and called each day afterwards making every attempt to come by and write the name on the check and pay the little one day late fee. Well surprisingly no one answered from my number, so I sent another email stating that I have left several voice messages and emails offering to come by and provide a resolve, with no feedback from anyone. ( Keep in mind my family was in the hospital which is why I was n't at home to begin with or else I could have just walked a couple of feet and resolved the issue ). Finally she responded after I threaten to go to the owners of the property. She responded via email and said that now I owed more lates fees. plus my regular rent and eviction fees because it had been filed 4 days later. So needless to report, she filed an eviction on me very swiftly. I was in court on the XXXX of XXXX attempting to prove I was not in the wrong. I brought a copy of all the emails and the copy of the check she sent me, the judge was not willing to here anything I said.. I mean nothing. I informed him that she had my check and if she was n't going to run it for {$870.00} that I made it out for, that she needed to give my check back because it had my account number on it. The judged ignored me as if I did n't say two words the entire time, never looked at any of my evidence per my request, never responded to the fact that I asked him to ask her if I had ever caused any issues or been late even one time, never acknowledged anything I said and did n't make her give the check back that she was not going to accept although I had over XXXX sitting in my acct. So it did n't stop there after she won the eviction I did a walk thru with her and someone she was training at the time. She confirmed verbally that there was no damages done to the property so I provided her the keys and something told me to take photos while she was present. I took the photo 's which I still have. Well a few months later it appears on my credit, I called her and inquired abt to fictitious charges, she said come by. She handed my an invoice, so I said this ca n't be for my unit because you and I did a walk thru upon me relinquishing the keys. She jsut looked at me and told me to excuse myself from the property, I left immediately with fear of her calling the authorities. Afterwards I emailed the owner and disputed it with the creditor. The owner said he would investigate only to come back and talk a lot of smack thru my email- I have proof of all of these emails, I mean one after another email. Well I disputed with the creditor verbally, the rep stated that she went back to the original creditor who stated they did n't have pictures of the damage or receipts"

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter through the mail for verification of debt. 

Under FCRA law, It says that I can submit a verification and if the creditor is unable to validate the debt, showing original signatures and proving that its my debt they must delete it. 

I have yet to receive a response from the company therefore they have violated my right."
Debt collection,"This letter serves as a request for immediate investigation and resolution of these issues. I recently became aware that information about my account has been shared with third parties without my explicit consent. As you are aware, such actions may violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( b ), which explicitly prohibits debt collectors from communicating with third parties in connection with the collection of a debt without the prior consent of the consumer or the express permission of a court. Additionally, I believe this conduct may be in violation of other applicable consumer protection laws, including but not limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), which restricts the sharing of nonpublic personal information with unauthorized third parties. I demand that you immediately cease and desist from sharing my personal information with any third party without my prior written consent. Furthermore, I request a detailed accounting of all entities with whom my personal information has been shared, including the nature and purpose of each disclosure. Under my rights as a consumer, I am demanding that you provide the original purchase agreement that substantiates this claim, including all terms and conditions that comply with applicable consumer protection laws. Additionally, I am requesting the Forward Flow Agreement, Chain of Assignment, Insurance Claim of Debt, and my signature agreeing to pay. If you are unable to produce this documentation, I expect this matter to be closed and any negative reporting to be removed immediately from my credit profile. Furthermore, I was never offered arbitration regarding this matter, which is a fundamental right under various consumer protection statutes. Your failure to provide such an option is a direct violation of fair debt collection practices and due process. Any attempt to continue pursuing this matter without proper validation will be considered an act of bad faith and will be met with legal action if necessary. I expect a response within 30 days from the date of this letter. What I received from my initial complaint was not what was requested."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","my rights have been violated according to the FDCPA, 15 usc 1692. As the original creditor and natural person i did not give this company permission to report any of my personal information to any consumer reporting agencies. According to 15 usc 1692d ( a ) ( 2 ), a company can not report anything negative to my consumer report that will ruin my reputation. The FCRA, 15 usc 1681, states our consumer reports represent us. Therefore, they are ruining my reputation. 15 usc 1666 they can not report alleged late payments to my consumer report.

These alleged late payments have not been validated, according to 15 usc 1692g it has to be validated for it to be put on a consumer report."

Pursuant to 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) and 1692g ( b ), I request the following : Complete validation of the alleged debt, including : A full itemization showing the original balance, interest, fees, payments, and credits ; The full name and address of the original creditor ; Date of default or charge-off. 

Proof of ownership and legal right to collect, including : A complete chain of title or assignment history from the original creditor to Springs Oak Capital ; Copies of purchase agreements, contracts of assignment, or bills of sale ; A copy of the original signed agreement or credit application that created the alleged obligation. 

Proof of proper debt notification in accordance with 12 CFR 1006.34 ( a ) including whether you sent a validation notice within five ( 5 ) days of your initial communication.

Absent this documentation, you are not legally authorized to pursue collection or credit reporting activities. Any continued attempt to collect without sufficient proof of ownership and authority will be deemed a willful violation of : 15 U.S.C. 1692e false or misleading representations ; 15 U.S.C. 1692f unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt ; 12 CFR 1006.18 deceptive representations about legal status or authority.

Intent to Litigate If your office can not provide full validation and documentation within 15 business days, I will take legal action to : Seek declaratory relief that the debt is invalid or uncollectible, Pursue damages for violations of the FDCPA, Regulation F, and applicable state consumer protection statutes, Demand injunctive relief including tradeline deletion and cessation of collection.

In addition, I have preserved my right to compel arbitration or file a civil action in state or federal court as appropriate. You are hereby placed on notice that failure to comply may result in formal legal proceedings.

If no sufficient response is received, your silence will be treated as failure to validate, and I will proceed accordingly."
Debt collection,"I want to stress that I did not give written permission for these specific transactions to be included in my consumer report. At no point did I authorize these entries, and their presence on my report is unwarranted. Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity. I trust that you will handle this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Please confirm the removal of these transactions from my report as soon as possible.

I am a federally protected consumer and a natural living woman with constitutionally protected rights, including the right to financial privacy, due process, and freedom from unlawful collection activity. 

1. FDCPA Violations 15 U.S. Code 1692 et seq.

Your communication, dated referencing an alleged debt of {$640.00} related to a purported XXXX  XXXX account ending in XXXX, contains multiple violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, including but not limited to : Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) : You failed to include proper legal disclosure regarding my right to dispute the debt. The letter did not include a statement of the name of the current creditor clearly. Simply listing XXXX  XXXX, XXXX. is vague and fails to establish the chain of assignment or legal ownership of the debt. 

Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692e and 1692f : It is deceptive and misleading to represent that I owe a debt without providing lawful verification, sworn affidavit, or original documentation. Presenting a balance without documentary evidence or a signed contract is a misrepresentation.

Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ) : If any previous cease and desist request was issued, continued collection attempts would constitute harassment and unlawful communication.
Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 8 ) : If this unverified debt was reported to any consumer reporting agency, you have communicated false and misleading information knowing it was disputed or unverifiable. 

2.

You have failed to demonstrate : That I provided written authorization for you to access or use any of my personal financial information ; That any contract exists permitting you to communicate regarding this alleged debt.

This may constitute unauthorized access to and misuse of my personal financial data.

3. Possible Identity Theft I have no recollection nor have I been presented with any signed agreement or lawful documentation bearing my wet signature proving this alleged account is mine. This raises serious concern regarding : Identity theft under 18 U.S. Code 1028 ; Data breach or misappropriation of my identity by third parties ; Unauthorized and unlawful use of my identity to pursue a debt that may have originated through fraudulent means.

4. Demand for Full Validation Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) Pursuant to federal law, you are required to cease all collection activities until you provide lawful and verifiable evidence of the following : A copy of the original contract bearing my wet signature ; A full itemized accounting of the alleged debt, including fees, interest, and payments ; Documentation showing the legal transfer or assignment of the account from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. to Radius Global Solutions ; Sworn affidavit or verification under penalty of perjury attesting to the legitimacy and accuracy of this alleged debt. 
If you can not provide the above within 30 days of this notice, you are hereby instructed to : Cease and desist all communication and collection activities ; Delete any reporting of this alleged debt from all credit bureaus ; Provide written confirmation that this matter is permanently closed.

In XX/XX/XXXX we stopped paying the Mortgage.

After we found a larger property to rent, Bank of America changed the locks barring us from entering the property XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX. We still tried to work with them but every 2 months they would say they were missing paperwork and the process needed to start over from scratch. In XX/XX/XXXX we filed Bankruptcy hoping that would give us a reprieve from BOA and the largely upside down property. We were discharged from bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX. Unbeknownst to us, We now do not qualify for a new mortgage because A. we have a recent bankruptcy B. the property is still in my wife 's name ( even though the locks have been changed ) C.

We want to move on with our lives but there does not seem to be a way to do so ... Furthermore we will not qualify as 1st time home buyers when our Bankruptcy discharge hits 3 years, because BOA has refused to finalize the process they started 6 years ago."

When a person enters a contract because of his justifiable reliance on a misrepresentation about some important fact, the contract is voidable. Misrepresentations can be either : 1. innocent ( not intentionally deceptive ) or 2. fraudulent ( made with the knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive ). Contracts induced by misrepresentation or fraud are generally considered voidable. This means that the person whose consent was not real has the power to rescind ( cancel ) the contract. The elements of misrepresentation and fraud are as follows - notice the similarities. ( authors addition ) Innocent misrepresentation Fraud 1. Untrue assertion of fact ( or equivalent ) 2. Assertion relates to material fact 3. Actual reliance 4. Justifiable reliance 1. Untrue assertion of fact ( or equivalent ) 2. Assertion made with knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive 3. Actual reliance 4. Justifiable reliance 5. Economic loss ( in a tort action for damages PARTS OF A LAWFULCONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by anylawto which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, XXXX, XXXX or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being eitherartificialLegal Entity and artificial Legal Entity,  orliving Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties butnevera mixture of these kinds. 2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosureis the act of providing all material information, or telling the whole truth, about anymatterwhich may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 4. Sufficient consideration Theconsiderationis something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must eachreceive a benefitand eachsuffer a detriment.To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates.
6. Meeting of the minds Ameeting of the minds consensus ad idem, occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. Thismeeting of mindscan only occur between like kinds, beingLegal Entity with Legal Entity, orMan/Woman with Man/Woman.A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way ofaccommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet inksignaturesof the parties, each wet inksignaturebeing anaccommodationfrom a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet inkautographsof the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Livingstandingis recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by anunambiguous declarationwith theautograph, such asauthorised agentwritten below.
8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties. Best Regards XXXX XXXX cc Federal Trade Commission Key Concept 6 Misrepresentation and Fraud 1 A misrepresentation is an assertion that is not in accord with the truth. When a person enters a contract because of his justifiable reliance on a misrepresentation about some important fact, the contract is voidable. Misrepresentations can be either : 1. innocent ( not intentionally deceptive ) or 2. fraudulent ( made with the knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive ). Contracts induced by misrepresentation or fraud are generally considered voidable. This means that the person whose consent was not real has the power to rescind ( cancel ) the contract.
The elements of misrepresentation and fraud are as follows - notice the similarities. ( authors addition ) Innocent misrepresentation Fraud 1. Untrue assertion of fact ( or equivalent ) 2. Assertion relates to material fact 3. Actual reliance 4. Justifiable reliance 1. Untrue assertion of fact ( or equivalent ) 2. Assertion made with knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive 3. Actual reliance 4. Justifiable reliance 5. Economic loss ( in a tort action for damages 1. Untrue Assertion of Fact or Equivalent ( authors addition ) To have misrepresentation, one of the parties must have made : 1. an untrue assertion of fact or 2. engaged in conduct that is equivalent to an untrue assertion of fact. The fact must be a past or existing fact, as distinguished from : 1. an opinion or 2. a promise or prediction about some future happening.
The concealment of a fact through some active conduct intended to prevent the other party from discovering the fact is considered the equivalent of an assertion. For example, if Summers is offering his house for sale and paints the ceilings to conceal the fact that the roof leaks, his active concealment constitutes an assertion of fact.
Nondisclosure can also be the equivalent of an assertion of fact. Nondisclosure is the failure to volunteer information. Disclosure of a fact is required when : 1. the person has already offered some information but further information is needed to give the other party an accurate picture or 2. there is a relationship of trust and confidence between the parties or 1 Source of materials : Mallor, et al., Business Law and the Regulatory Environment : Concepts and Cases ( XXXX XXXX/XXXX , 11th Edition, XX/XX/XXXX ). Bold print, bullets, and numbers have been added to the Mallor text to indicate particular emphasis.
3. a party has access to information that is not readily available to the other party.
Transactions involving the sale of real estate are among the most common situations in which the duty to disclose arises. Most states hold that a seller who knows about a latent ( hidden ) defect that materially affects the value of the property has the obligation to speak up about the defect. For example, in a recent case a buyer contracted to purchase a house that was reputed, according the sellers, to be possessed with ghosts.
The sellers did not tell the buyer this fact. When the buyer learned of the houses reputation, he was granted the right to sue for rescission. ( authors addition ) 2. Materiality Innocent misrepresentation If the misrepresentation was innocent, the person seeking to rescind the contract must establish that the fact asserted was material.
A fact will be considered material if it is : 1. likely to play a significant role in inducing a reasonable person to enter the contract or 2. if the person asserting the fact knows that the other person is likely to rely on the fact.
For example, XXXX who is trying to sell his car to XXXX and knows that XXXX idolizes professional bowlers, tells XXXX that a XXXX XXXX once rode in the car. Relying on that representation, XXXX buys the car.
Although the fact XXXX  asserted might not be important to most people, it would be material here.
Fraud Even if the fact is not material, the contract may be rescinded if the misrepresentation was fraudulent. Fraud is the type of misrepresentation that is committed knowingly, with the intent to deceive. The rationale for this rule is that a person who fraudulently misrepresents a fact should not be able to profit from his intentionally deceptive conduct.
A person making a misrepresentation would be considered to do so knowingly if she : 1. knew her statement was false or 2. knew that she did not have a basis for making the statement or 3. made the statement without being confident that it was true.
The intent to deceive can be inferred from the fact that the defendant knowingly made a misstatement of fact to a person who was likely to rely on it.
3. Actual Reliance Reliance means that a person pursues some course of action because of his faith in the assertion made to him.
There must have been a causal connection between the assertion and the complaining partys decision to enter the contract.
If the complaining party ( 1 ) knew that the assertion was false or ( 2 ) was not aware that an assertion had been made, there is no reliance.
4. Justifiable Reliance Courts also scrutinize the reasonableness of the behavior of the complaining party by requiring that his reliance be justifiable.
A person does not act justifiably if he relies on an assertion that is : 1. obviously false or 2. not to be taken seriously.
One problem involving the justifiable reliance element is determining the extent to which the relying party is responsible for investigating the accuracy of the statement on which he relies.
o Classical contract law held that a person who did not attempt to discover readily discoverable facts ( e.g. public records - authors addition ) generally was not justified in relying on the other partys statements about them.
o The extent of the responsibility placed on a relying party to conduct an independent investigation has declined in modern contract law. Todays courts tend to place a greater degree of accountability on the person who makes the assertion rather than the person who relies.
5. Economic loss In tort actions in which the plaintiff is seeking to recover damages for fraud, the plaintiff would have to establish a fifth element : injury. He would have to prove that he had suffered actual economic injury because of his reliance on the fraudulent assertion. In cases in which the injured person seeks only rescission of the contract, however, proof of economic injury usually is not required.
Remedies Rescission As is true for innocent misrepresentation, the contract remedy for fraudulent misrepresentation is rescission. A person who rescinds a contract is entitled to the return of anything he gave the other party. He must offer to return anything he has received from the other party.
Necessity for prompt and unequivocal rescission Suppose XXXX  who recently bought a car from XXXX XXXX learns that XXXX XXXX made fraudulent statements to her to induce her to buy the car. She believes the contract was induced by fraud and wants to rescind. She must : 1. object promptly upon learning the facts and 2. must clearly express her intent to cancel.
She must also avoid any behavior that would suggest that she affirms or ratifies the contract, such as : 1. an unreasonable delay in notifying the other party or 2. continuing to accept benefits from the other party or 3. behaving in a way that is inconsistent with her expressed intent to rescind.
Damages The tort liability of a person who commits fraud is different from that of a person who commits innocent misrepresentation. A person who commits fraud may be liable for damages, possibly including punitive damages, for the tort of deceit.
In some states, a person injured by fraud can not rescind and sue for damages for deceit ; he must elect ( choose ) between the remedies. In other states, however, an injured party may pursue both rescission and damage remedies. In addition, a person injured by fraud in a contract for the sale of goods can both rescind and sue for damages.
Innocent misrepresentation Fraud Rescission rescission and/or tort action in damages Am Jur 2d - Contracts 1 0 New I. In General, A. Definitions, 1 - Contract A contract has been defined as an agreement to do, or refrain from doing, a particular thing, [ 1 ] upon a sufficient consideration. [ 2 ] Similarly, a "" contract '' has been defined as an agreement, obligation, or legal tie by which a party binds itself, or becomes bound, expressly or impliedly, to pay a sum of money or to perform or omit to do some certain act or thing. [ 3 ] Also, a "" contract '' has been defined as a private, voluntary allocation by which two or more parties distribute specific entitlements and obligations. [ 4 ] A "" contract '' is an agreement between two or more parties that creates obligations that are legally enforceable by the contracting parties. [ 5 ] A "" contract '' is an agreement between two or more parties creating obligations that are enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law. [ 6 ] A "" contract '' is an agreement by two or more parties whereby obligations are created, modified, or extinguished. [ 7 ] A contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct. [ 8 ] The term "" contract '' has been held to include every description or agreement or obligation, whether verbal or written, by which one party becomes bound to another to pay a sum of money or to perform or omit to do a certain act. [ 9 ] The Restatement defines the term "" contract '' as a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty, [ 10 ] and this definition has been adopted by some courts. [ 11 ] However, this has been criticized as a circular definition : it is the same as saying that a contract is a legally enforceable promise, but a promise is legally enforceable only if it is a contract. [ 12 ] A contract is not a law, nor does it make law : it is the agreement plus the law that makes the ordinary contract an enforceable obligation. [ 13 ] Caution : The following types of contracts are subject in some respects to special rules that depend on their formal characteristics and differ from those governing contracts in general : [ 14 ] contracts under seal recognizances negotiable instruments and documents letters of credit When used in its ordinary sense, the term "" contract '' implies enforceable obligations. [ 15 ] However, in popular speech, the word "" contract '' is frequently used as meaning the work done under a contract. [ 16 ] Observation : A contract is a verbal act that has a legal reality independent of the truth of any statement contained in it. [ 17 ] The right to perform a contract and to receive its profits and the right to performance by the other party are property rights entitling each party to the fulfillment of the contract by performance. [ 18 ] Under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, the term "" contract '' means the total legal obligation resulting from the parties ' agreement as affected by the act and other applicable law. [ 19 ] The term "" contract '' has a more specific and extended meaning than the terms "" promise '' or "" agreement. "" [ 20 ] The existence of a contract is a question of fact. [ 21 ] Tallies or receipts [ 22 ] and invoices [ 23 ] are generally not contracts.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I have been extremely hard at work getting my credit scores up. For some reason, the only credit score I have that is not reflecting positive changes is my Experian score. It has not moved a single point in a positive direction all year. Where as my XXXX score has gone up 80+ points and my XXXX has gone up 65+ points since the beginning of this year. I am desperate to improve all three of my scores, as I am buying a home, and a better score will afford me a better interest rate, which is something I need as a XXXX mother of XXXX, in order to afford to move forward. My XXXX score is nearly 700, and my XXXX score is well over 650. I feel as though someone is not doing their job, or perhaps an entire department is lacking for the credit reporting agency I am referencing, Experian. 

One of my credit cards is still not reflecting on my Experian report, which may be a factor as to why my score has not improved or moved at all. I have called and reported this issue to both my credit card company which assured me the information has been transmitted to all 3 agencies every month. I called Experian customer service on three separate occasions to resolve this, but they were no help and blamed it on my credit card company. I was told and I qoute "" There is nothing I can do to help you, call XXXX XXXX ''. XXXX XXXX  stated they sent the correspondence to Experian at the initiation of my account. The other two agencies both XXXX and XXXX have corrected all errors, and include each one of my cards. They have deleted most inaccurate information and my scores went up significantly. 

XXXX XXXX instructed me to send them a letter so they could reach out to Experian, I did so over 60 days ago and have heard absolutely nothing back from Experian. I need my Experian score to go up. I can not understand why it has not. Especially because there is such a large discrepancy between the other two credit reporting agencies. Currently my Experian score is XXXX, and my XXXX score for example is XXXX. Typically I would assume, there are not such large differences in the scores. 

Experian company claimed that they sent me correspondence regarding an initial complaint I filed in reference to disputed items on my credit report that are fraudulent, inaccurate or otherwise outdated. I did not receive summaries of the disputed items that were removed, or those that the company claims should legitimately remain, as Experian stated, although, I still dispute that. I do not believe their investigation was thorough enough, as I still believe the information on my file that still stands is outdated, inaccurate, or straight up fraudulently reported by the agency of collection itself. It is my intention to seek retribution for any and all trouble these continued issues have and will cause me in the near future during my homebuying experience. 

As a XXXX mother to XXXX children, it is of the utmost importance credit agencies report accurate information that has not otherwise been tampered with by collections agencies or even worse yet, original creditors. It goes beyond a simple inconvenience. A credit score now a days, can determine ones livelihood. Especially in today 's world, where anything of value, like a home or car is not obtainable through an outright purchase for most Americans. It must be financed. Credit determines not just eligibility, but also interest rates, which translates to cost of living for any individual. With this Agency holding onto false information, inaccurately reported information, information that is outdated ect, and my score not going up or moving at all, they are causing me direct and deliberate injury both financially and emotionally."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","My daughter missed her first payment to XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I found out and called XXXX XXXX in XXXX to handle this ( I cosigned ). The rep told me he sees it all the time, and I should just take over payments. He offered me a reduced interest rate as incentive, and I agreed. 

I made the first payment that night ( XXXX ) and continued over the next months as per the agreement. However, in XXXX I was told by XXXX XXXX that they rescinded the offer made in XXXX, and I was now several months late ( even though they were still taking payments directly from my account ). 

Within 2 days I paid XXXX they said was now due. In any case it was too late and they reported me as delinquent to XXXX XXXX. I wrote XXXX XXXX a letter explaining this, and they refused to remove the mark. 

They did call me between XXXX and XXXX, telling me I was late ( even though they were auto debiting the full amount from my account ). I'd call and explain the agreement, and they would apologize for the confusion, assuring me it was a system error or some such. 

I have email history from my XXXX XXXX account, which I can provide if necessary ( just need to make sure I'm not crossing legal lines in doing so ). I also have detailed notes about all of this."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I have a major problem with the credit bureaus.

It has come to my attention that Kinum Inc. has placed or continues to report inaccurate or unauthorized information on my credit report.

I hereby demand that Kinum Inc. immediately : 1. Cease all reporting of any and all information related to me on my credit report without proper authorization.

XXXX. Provide me with written confirmation within XXXX  days of receipt of this letter that all information related to me has been removed from my credit report and that no further reporting will occur without my express consent.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","On XX/XX/2021 I uncovered Experiential Proof that TransUnion Employs Systemic Predatory Credit Reporting Practices designed to intentionally harm people. 

I have a lot of credit which I keep below a 10 % Credit Utilization Ratio and pay off all cards every month except for 1 XXXX  XXXX XXXX card that was on a 0 % Promo. 

That promo was set to expire and so I was going to pay it off when I received an amazing offer from XXXX XXXX. 

{$10000.00} at 0 % and no Fees of any kind for 18 months so I transferred my XXXX  XXXX XXXX balance whose promo was about to end and a couple of other small cards plus a principle reduction payment to XXXX XXXX  to round out the {$10000.00} So on Tuesday XX/XX/2021 I paid off {$10000.00} of debt and to my surprise that made no impact to my credit report whatsoever. Not even a 1 point increase. 

My score was XXXX and that is where it stayed. 

Then on Sunday XX/XX/2021 when XXXX card reported to TransUnion, TransUnion dropped my score and incredible 111 points and 2 days later on XX/XX/2021 just for good measure TransUnion dropped my score another point bringing me from XXXX all the way down to XXXX or from excellent don't to Yikes! Don't give this guy any credit. 

Just in time to refi my mortgage and take advantage of the current super low rates. I was quoted 1.75 % on a 15 year and now ... They don't even want me to submit an application until this is corrected because it will be denied. 

It is very clear that TransUnion probably in coordination with the big banks has made this change to their algorithm intentionally to hurt people by causing them to have to pay higher rates on all financial products. 

I have done balance transfers in the past with no impact because obviously they can see transfers are lateral moves that make good financial sense and are an indication of smart money management vs a potential problem. 

I contacted TransUnion and they were not helpful at all. Finally, the rep offered to transfer me to a supervisor who might be able to help and I heard the words ... "" I'm not gon na do anything about it '' followed by my being hung up on by the supervisor at TransUnion. 

This isn't right! 

Please help me and the thousands or even millions of good hard working responsible people who TransUnion is systematically and intentionally hurting with their unfair, unjust and predatory credit reporting and scoring practices. 

Thank you ..."

Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX, Hurricane Helene affected our area. We placed a call requesting any assistance, a forbearance was agreed on. XX/XX/XXXX ( believed the XXXX ) a phone call was placed to PHH that we no longer needed the forbearance, referencing to remove it, or cancel it ( just we didn't need it ). The agent ID's.was written down. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, we each were declined on credit ( unusual ). XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ( while applying for an RV loan ) a loan officer alerted us that remarks were on our credit from PHH mortgage. ( Forebearance ) A phone call was placed to PHH, assuring it would be taken care of. ( Not at any time was it denied on the phone that PHH still considered us to have used that Forbearance ) Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, calls placed by XXXX to get this forbearance off of our credit began again. In XXXX a dispute on XXXX  was refused to remove the comment by the "" data furnisher ''. A request was placed to view the phone call placed by XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  a letter was received by PHH mortgage stating we were "" in the forbearance '' of XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( the above mentioned months ) therefore "" credit reporting '' can't be changed UNLESS an ERROR was found on their burden. ( STILL admitting they were aware it was on our credit reporting as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ), then another letter was received on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  that states the first letter ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ) was incorrect and to keep the "" updated response '' ( this XX/XX/XXXX letter ) & that the forbearance comment would be removed ( another indication they were aware of the forbearance comment on our credit report as of XXXX of XXXX ). Also is is a letter from "" XXXX of Escalations dated XX/XX/XXXX, stated that a "" sincerely apologize for the frustration and inconvenience '' and accepting responsibility for the "" forbearance not cancelled as expected ''. ( another indication for the fault of PHH mortgage knowing the forbearance should have been cancelled. Also, there is a screenshot of a disputed report of XXXX  to where as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  that as the "" data furnisher '' would not remove the comment of "" forbearance, payment deferral '' in which PHH was ANOTHER indication that PHH knew or should have known that this was on my & my husbands credit for now 9 months. During this time, over 30 calls were made with all ID 's known ( we have all the ID 's times ), and as the more I became stressed, frustrated and physically ill, we received a letter of "" facts '' from XXXX XXXX of the OFFICE OF OMBUDSMAN with deceptive facts. XXXX XXXX was unaware or didn't appear to be aware to when he submitted a letter that stated three things OPPOSITE of the finding already explained in PHH response letters. XXXX XXXX stated we were under the forbearance in XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Which is UNTRUE. PHH 's letter from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  & XX/XX/XXXX to us is the factual information. XXXX XXXX made the statement that he reviewed ALL of the phone calls from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  to XX/XX/XXXX and at 'NO TIME WAS A REQUEST MADE BY YOU TO REMOVE THE FORBEARANCE as you ASSERTED ''. First, this is only XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and I haven't made any phone calls in XX/XX/XXXX. PHH already verified the existence of that "" cancellation request '' REMOVING the information from our credit report explanation in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ( reference letter ). During the meantime, we have written XXXX XXXX ( CEO ) because upon ALL of this confusion, and the letter of supposed "" facts '' from XXXX XXXX there is XXXX confidence whatsoever of a timely resolve to stop this mental, emotional, physical pain and torment. It was requested to investigate XXXX XXXX due that the slanderous statement calling myself a liar. This has been going on for months. Not to mention the 10 months our credit was affected. It has impacted our life, it's impacted our credit. Even XXXX XXXX explained that having a "" forbearance '' impacts decision making on credit prospects in his XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  letter .. ( paraphrase ). There is one other person I need to address. Representative XXXX. One can only imagine how stressful this is on a consumer to constantly BEG a company to correct their names & credit. To find the integrity to do "" the right thing ''. To stop the cloud of "" worry if the people who hold their mortgage '' are honest or not. Upon receiving that letter from XXXX XXXX, we went from being happy we were consumers of PHH mortgage, however that has been damaged. We are concerned of retaliation because we can't be harmed anymore than we already have. Concerning XXXX  XXXX. On the phone with XXXX it appeared that he was trying to convince me to believe somethings were "" not factual ''. XXXX raised his voice at me on that phone call on XXXX, XXXX and was referencing the confusion and I stated "" I should just put this all on XXXX  or XXXX XXXX and let the world see if they can figure this out '', however it is my understanding that a derogatory comment is listed on our profile that is a "" hostile '' word such as threat. That is slander as well. At best it was sarcasm to the lack of ability to problem solve within the corporation. ALL we asked WAS FOR this to be corrected AFTER we didn't want the forbearance, and in XX/XX/XXXX, I STILL called and it wasn't corrected. PHH did not remove that Forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX, because they REFUSED to REMOVE IT on XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX. It was disputed in XXXX of XXXX. In the XX/XX/XXXX it is also stated for us to be patient that it was being removed. ( Another indication PHH was aware the comments were there. We begged this not get this far, we didn't want to write. We would say we were, then hang up the phone and talk ourselves out of it.... Yet we just can't take this anymore, and need help to resolve.it. 

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  a letter was also received today from the Office of Ombudsman stating they saw "" no error ''. the screen shots show the comments that were there. There was a misplaced screenshot on my behalf sent to the Ombudsman and it reflected the XXXX XXXX  months, and that is where it was corrected. This error should show the extreme mental, physical, emotional duress trying to call a company 30+ and take care of XXXX veteran as well. 

We have no idea WHY this was done to us. We feel slandered in a sense. WE just do."
Mortgage,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Triad Financial Services regarding serious concerns with the management of my mortgage account.

Despite my mortgage including an escrow account specifically for the purpose of covering property and county taxes, Triad Financial Services has failed to make timely payments on my behalf. This negligence has resulted in unnecessary stress and penalties from my local tax authorities, something that should never occur when escrow funds are being collected and held for this exact reason.

In addition, I have attempted multiple times to work with Triad Financial Services regarding the due date of my monthly mortgage payment. While my payments have been made consistently every month, I have been met with inflexibility and lack of cooperation. I am not requesting to miss payments, only to adjust the timing in a reasonable manner that still ensures full payment each month.

I find it unacceptable that a financial institution responsible for managing a legally binding agreement would show such disregard for its responsibilities and its customers. I am requesting an immediate investigation into : Why my escrow funds are not being applied to pay my property and county taxes in a timely manner.

Why Triad Financial Services refuses to work with me on adjusting my payment date, despite my on-time monthly payments.

If this issue is not resolved promptly and fairly, I will be forced to escalate the matter to regulatory bodies including the CFPB and potentially pursue legal counsel. 
Sincerely,"

Furthermore, the collection agency has indicated that there is no amount due and that no further action is necessary. This inconsistency and the ongoing reporting of this collection account are causing damage to my creditworthiness. 

Request : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and assist in ensuring that the collection account is either verified as accurate or removed from my credit report promptly, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Please find attached all relevant correspondence and documentation regarding this dispute. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","My problem is with the credit reporting agency Experian. Experion is not including any of the credit I have on my credit report. This has negatively impacted my credit score. I have contacted creditors to ensure that they are reporting to Experian. My mortgage company sent a letter stating they have been reporting to Experian. The mortgage company stated in the letter that they contacted Experian to ensure the information was being received. Experion stated they had received the information, but they had an identity verification concern, and I would need to contact them. 

I attempted to contact Experian to resolve this issue. However, all I got was an automated telephone menu. There is not option for the issue I am having. There is no option for the general public to actually talk to someone in an effort to resolve issues. I feel this is intentional, and an unfair practice. The consumer agencies have total control over one 's credit and the consumer have no real way to resolve issues with them. I wrote a letter of dispute but got no real answer as to why they are not including my credit information that is reported to them on my credit report.

Each time I contact the 3 credit reporting agencies for a credit report, I get the same run around from Experian, about needing more information. Over the years they should have corrected my information. 

There are several companies reporting my credit to Experion and this needs to be resolved. IT IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING MY CREDIT SCORE."

The following laws highlight specific consumer rights that I believe have been infringed upon in this case : XXXX. 12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ) - Under this regulation, debt collectors are obligated to provide certain information about the debt in their initial communication, including details essential to identify the nature and validity of the debt. Jefferson Capital Systems failed to meet this requirement by not providing clear, specific, and sufficient information to validate the debt. 


XXXX. 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ) - This rule requires debt collectors to provide certain validation information regarding the amount owed, including itemization and any fees, interest, or charges accrued since the debt 's last transaction. Jefferson Capital Systems has not itemized these elements in their communications with me, which constitutes a violation of my rights. 


XXXX. 12 CFR 1006.34 ( d ) - According to this law, the collector must supply a validation notice, detailing the rights I have as a consumer to dispute or request additional information about the debt. Jefferson Capital Systems has not provided a validation notice that meets these requirements. 


XXXX. 15 USC 1692g ( a ) ( 7 ) - The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act requires collectors to inform consumers of their right to dispute the debt. Jefferson Capital Systems has not adequately communicated this right to me, thereby infringing upon my rights under this law. 



Additionally, I am concerned that Jefferson Capital Systems may be engaging in a practice known as "" re-aging, '' where the date of last activity on this account is manipulated to appear more recent. This could unfairly extend the statute of limitations and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, resulting in further damage to my credit. 

Due to XXXX XXXX XXXX with the above laws and my inability to determine the legitimacy of this debt, I am formally demanding that this account be removed from my consumer report to resolve this issue. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter to ensure Jefferson Capital Systems ceases any re-aging practices, removes the account from my report, and upholds consumers rights as stipulated under federal regulations. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if additional information is needed to assist with your investigation. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","This bureau has been contacted several times regarding these inquiries in order to have them removed from my credit report.

Debt collection,"Five years ago, I financed a XXXX vehicle and was making regular payments. Unfortunately, the vehicle began to overheat and eventually stopped working. I initially took it to a mechanic but was advised that the issue required dealership intervention. Upon taking it to the dealership, I was informed that a key component had failed and that the part was no longer being manufactured at the time, with an estimated wait time of 3 to 6 months.

As you can imagine, it was not feasible for me to be without a vehicle for such a long period. I had no choice but to purchase another car and return the XXXX to the dealership. The vehicle was picked up from my apartment, yet I was later told I still owed nearly {$5000.00}. I refused to pay this amount because I believe it is unfair, the situation arose through no fault of my own, and the lender was unable to provide a timely solution. 
At the time, I was told I would have to continue paying for a vehicle that was no longer operational, which I found unreasonable. Nearly five years have passed, and this alleged debt continues to appear in collections on my credit report, severely impacting my creditworthiness.

I have disputed this account multiple times with the credit bureaus, but the item remains on my report with no resolution in my favor. I do not intend to pay for a vehicle that was defective and for which I received no viable repair solution. I was forced to incur additional costs by purchasing another car due to the circumstances."

Mortgage,"I was contacted by PennyMac regarding an FHA XXXX XXXX. After agreeing to move forward, the terms discussed included bringing one months payment to closing. I locked in my interest rate at 5.99 %, and they estimated a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
After locking my rate, communication from PennyMac was minimal. For three weeks, I received little to no updates. Despite repeated calls, my loan officer did not return any of them. I attempted to get clarity by speaking with the processing team, but they seemed unsure of the situation. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, Ive been receiving emails indicating I would need to bring more cash to close. Every time I spoke with my loan officer prior to that, he reassured me that I only needed to bring one months payment. He told me not to worry and that he would figure it out. 

On XXXX XXXX days before the estimated closingI received a call informing me I would now need to bring two months of payments due to an alleged system error that failed to include the current months payment. When I challenged this and requested to speak with a manager, I was finally connected with one ( XXXX ) after a 45-minute wait. 

XXXX told a different story : that the increase wasnt due to a missed payment, but because my escrow went up. Even then, he admitted that the new amount still didnt add up. When I pressed further, he asked if I really expected to make only one month 's payment to close an FHA loan, implying that the original loan officer was wrong. I pointed out that this meant I had been misled. His response : Ill coach him not to say that again, which didnt address the core issue. 

I asked XXXX to review the call recordings where I was repeatedly told I would only need {$3700.00} to close. He dismissed the idea, saying he wouldnt listen to four hours of calls. Eventually, he offered a refund of the {$250.00} I paid to lock in the rate. 

This entire experience feels like a bait-and-switch. I strongly suspect theyre attempting to get out of honoring the 5.99 % rate I locked in. Changing the terms this close to closing, providing inconsistent explanations, and refusing to review recorded calls only confirms my concern."

Debt collection,"This collection agency is furnishing an alleged debt that is on my consumer report XXXX and XXXX The collection SOUTHWEST RECOVERY SERVICES has not provided me with the proper validation according to 15 usc 1692g. Also they have violated 15 usc 1692f.

This is a violation of my right to privacy.

I have never given them prior consent to contact me which is a violation of 15 usc 1692c This account is blatantly illegal under federal law. I am under no duty to pay a debt collector the purported sum until it is proven differently. However, they have committed identity theft because I never gave them permission to share any of my personal information with you. I have never received any documentation that I have a business relationship with SOUTHWEST RECOVERY SERVCES or that I owe any obligations to them. Identity theft is demonstrated by their failure to prove this. The reason for this is that if they indicate supposed Statements from an original creditor, this is a type of identity theft perpetrated not just by the collection agency, but also by you by reporting this without physical proof.

The company has violated the following laws 15 usc 1692c ( a ) ( 1 ) calling the consumer at an unusual time or place 5 times ( {$5000.00} ) 15 usc 1692c ( a ) ( 3 ) calling at the consumers work place when it is prohibited to recieve such communication. 2 times {$2000.00} 15 usc 1692d ( 5 ) Causing the telephone to ring repeatedly with intent to annoy, Abuse or harass any person at the called number {$3000.00} I know that the company is in violation of federal law.

Mortgage,"I filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy in XXXX in XXXX. I have been consistently making my Trustee payments. XXXX XXXX XXXX HELOC was included in this bankruptcy. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating they will no longer service my loan. The new servicer will be Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC. I never received any information from Specialized Loan Servicing regarding my account, monthly payment amount, and how to submit payments. I attempted to set up an online account with Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) and was prevented from doing so. I called SLS and spoke to XXXX and he told me to pay {$830.00}. I called my attorneys office ( XXXX XXXX and spoke to his legal assistant XXXX to inform her that XXXX has not provided me with any account number nor any written documentation regarding my loan. My attorney contacted XXXX  and XXXX  wanted me to pay {$4000.00} to start a payment plan. I told my attorney that I only have {$3000.00}. I sent a personal check to XXXX for {$3000.00} and XXXX sent the check back to me. Around this time I noticed XXXX charged off approximately {$80000.00} onto my credit report. Again, I contacted XXXX at my attorneys office to let her know XXXX  did not accept my XXXX payment and has now put the full balance owed on my credit report. XXXX told me she will contact XXXX. I told XXXX that I will not make any payments unless XXXX pulls the loan back from my credit report and provide access to a monthly statement. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a formal Creditors Certification Of Default from SSLs attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Fl and sent to the US Bankruptcy Court Chapter XXXX, Case No. XXXX. XXXX is proceeding to foreclose on my property without even giving me a chance to pay. XXXX  also never introduced themselves to me by lette, nor did XXXX provide a payment plan as they should have since this is an active Chapter XXXX bankruptcy. XXXX  was also making it difficult to make payments because they only wanted me to use Money Orders or Certified Cashier Check."
Debt collection,"Against : Transworld Systems & XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2025 I am submitting this complaint regarding a collection account in the amount of {$130.00}, originally owed to XXXX XXXX, and currently reported by Transworld Systems , Inc. ( TSI ) on my credit reports. 

I contacted both XXXX XXXX and Transworld Systems directly and clearly stated that I was willing to pay the full amount not negotiate, not settle for less in exchange for a simple written confirmation that the collection account would be removed from my credit reports upon payment. 

Both entities misled me, claiming that they can not remove the account from my credit report under any circumstances. That is not true. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers are not required to report to credit bureaus, and many furnishers have chosen to remove accounts as a goodwill deletion after payment. Their claim that they are legally prohibited from doing so is false and misleading. 

I find it unethical that a consumer trying to pay a debt in full is being denied a path to repair their credit. A paid collection still negatively affects a credit score, and lenders rarely differentiate between paid and unpaid derogatory items. In other words, consumers are punished either way, even when they try to do the right thing. 

This practice feels deceptive and anti-consumer. It discourages repayment by making the outcome pointless for the person trying to take responsibility. I feel this behavior undermines the purpose of debt resolution and credit repair entirely. 

Again, I was not trying to negotiate a discount. I called both companies with the intent to pay 100 % of the balance. I simply asked for a written statement confirming that the account would be deleted from my credit report once paid. I was told this was impossible due to law or policy again, neither of which is accurate. 

This kind of refusal and misinformation harms consumers and creates a no-win situation : either pay and still suffer derogatory marks, or dont pay and be labeled irresponsible. 

I respectfully request the CFPB to review these practices and investigate whether both companies are misrepresenting the law and harming consumers through deceptive and punitive reporting tactics. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter."

Debt collection,"I declared XXXX XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX XXXX and the bankruptcy was fully discharged in XXXX XXXX. The primary reason for declaring bankruptcy was the XXXX mortgage on my former primary residence in WY, and the deficiency resulting from a severe decline in property values. The loan and any deficiency was included in my bankruptcy filing and discharged with the bankruptcy. The original creditor was XXXX XXXX XXXX, then XXXX, with loan servicing maintained by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to the best of my knowledge. In XXXX XXXX, on the advice of XXXX separate attorneys and with their help, I deeded the property back to the creditors, with a deed drawn up by an attorney and filed by said attorney with the local record of deeds office in WY. Since the lenders had taken no steps to claim the property after more than XXXX months after filing the bankruptcy, and I was required to surrender the property to the lenders per my bankruptcy agreement, the attorneys advised me to take these steps. In XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from the original lender and loan servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, informing me that the loan in question would be transferred to a new servicer, Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ( "" Bayview '' ). In XXXX XXXX, Bayview began contacting me via phone, mail, and certified mail, with requests to pay its loan that had been discharged in my bankruptcy. They sent demand notices, Making Home Affordable paperwork ( which is ironic, because I spent about XXXX years trying to use the Making Home Affordable program prior to declaring bankruptcy as a last resort - I just picked up another Making Home Affordable notice from Bayview, sent to me via certified mail, today ), notice of insurance placed on the property, statements of account, etc. I spoke to representatives on the phone on several occasions and explained the situation, and let them know that they were violating the Fair Debt Collection Act and federal bankruptcy law by contacting me. In addition I sent a certified letter to Bayview on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, explaining the situation and providing a copy of the bankruptcy discharge. The contact stopped for about XXXX months, then began again in XXXX XXXX, with similar contacts continuing on a regular basis. In XXXX XXXX I realized that Bayview had put a defaulted loan on my credit reports with the XXXX credit reporting agencies. I contacted the credit reporting agencies and had Bayview 's reports removed from my credit reports with all XXXX agencies. The Bayview contacts subsided for awhile in XX/XX/XXXX and began again in XXXX XXXX, at which point they increased in intensity, occurring regularly through yesterday. Again, I have spoken to a representative on several occasions, explained the situation, emailed documents to him, asked him to resolve the situation on his end, and explained that Bayview is violating the Fair Debt Collection Act and federal bankruptcy law by continuing to contact me. The contact continues. I spoke to an attorney 's office in my area yesterday, who advised me that my best course of action to make this stop is to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I would be very grateful for any help you can give me in resolving this matter. It has been going on for four years, is emotional and disheartening for me and my family, and I would very much like to put it behind me. Thank you in advance for your time and help."
Mortgage,"I applied through Triad Financial Services 2 times between XX/XX/2024 and XX/XX/2024 for a home listed in XXXX, Iowa. I went and looked at the mobile home and applied for a specific address. this was on XX/XX/2024. My XXXX XXXX manager was emailed on XX/XX/XXXX to provide verification of employment. The verification of employment was sent back same day. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by the XXXX XXXX mobile home park manager asking me to call Triad to check on the status of my loan application because someone else had gone in and applied for the same address as I had. I then called several times that day and the week of XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX the underwriter on my loan application who told me repeatedly they were waiting on my verification of employment before they could continue processing my loan application. ( I do have call logs as well as text messages to confirm dates and communication between myself and the park manager XXXX and call logs calling Triad ).

Because my application was not processed in a timely manner the person who looked at and applied for the same address, also used Triad as their loan application and they were approved before my application. I went to look at more homes available at the mobile home park and none of them were what I was looking for. I had my XXXX set on the one I was told I would get because I had been first to apply for the loan on the home. I went to look at XXXX other homes on XX/XX/XXXX and that's when I found out after several calls to Triad and the manager at the mobile home park stating they did not have my verification of employment and within minutes Triad said they did have it. I have the email documents from my HR manager supporting dates as well.

Triad admitted to me they were at fault for dropping the ball on processing my application after 2 and a half weeks of them having my verification of employment on XX/XX/XXXX. I have tried contacting Triad today after being told yesterday XX/XX/XXXX that they would contact me today about a resolution for this situation and I can not get ahold of anyone at the company and now I am not getting back a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Iowa after calling and texting. 
I lost the home I applied for and wanted due to Triad 's negligence in processing my loan application in a timely manner and now I would like some sort of compensation for their negligence as well as the stress it has caused me and the emotional turmoil I have endured.

Mortgage,"Company : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( NewRez LLC ) Loan Number : XXXX Product : Mortgage Loan Servicing Issue : Failure to Timely Process Partial Release of Mortgage / Lack of Communication Complaint Narrative : I am the borrower on a mortgage serviced by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. I submitted a request for a Partial Release of Mortgage because I previously conveyed a subdivided parcel to a builder ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The builder has since constructed a home and is under contract to sell it.

Timeline of Events : XX/XX/year> I contacted Shellpoint requesting a partial release. Shellpoint responded the same day with a list of required documents. 

XX/XX/year> I submitted all requested documents within XXXX day. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I followed up repeatedly by email and phone with no response. The sale was originally scheduled to close on XX/XX/year>, but Shellpoints inaction delayed it. 

XX/XX/year> After I threatened to file complaints with the CFPB and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Shellpoint finally responded nearly 30 days after my original submission with an additional set of document requests. 

XX/XX/year> ( same day ) I promptly submitted all additional documents requested, including a survey, deed, legal description, builders sales contract, and draft release. 

XX/XX/year> ( today ) It has now been nearly XXXX weeks since my last submission, and I have received no response, acknowledgment, or timeline from Shellpoint. 

Harm : Shellpoints repeated lack of responsiveness and failure to process this routine partial release has delayed a legitimate closing, placed the buyers transaction at risk of cancellation, and caused significant financial harm to me and to third parties. 

I have always made my mortgage payments on time, and the partial release does not affect my repayment obligations. 

Requested Resolution : I request that the CFPB require Shellpoint to : Immediately confirm receipt and completeness of my submission, Assign a point of contact to this matter, and Expedite execution and recording of the Partial Release of Mortgage so the pending sale can proceed."

The interest for XXXX to XXXX seems fair but the compensation for loss of use for the ten years XXXX to XXXX, is not adequate. A fair compensation for loss of use of {$1500.00} for 10 years should have been closer to {$1000.00}, not {$140.00}.

His rhetoric that he posts raises serious fair-lending and fair-housing concerns. Please see the attached screenshots. 

Because Allied Mortgage Group operates in a highly regulated industry, public statements that express hostility toward protected classes create a reasonable concern that prospective borrowers could be discouraged or treated unfairly, in conflict with obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA/Reg B ) and the Fair Housing Act ( including prohibitions on discrimination and discouragement ).

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I secured this credit card as a means of building my credit. My Social Security number was changed due to XXXX XXXX, and as such- my credit history was deleted. I set this account up on Auto pay from my checking account and consistently made my monthly payments on time, well above the min. due amount. 

In XX/XX/2018, I contacted XXXX XXXX & inquired about my balance, and then made the payment in full online. I subsequently contacted by bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX and requested they put a stop payment on the XXXX XXXX auto payment for the month of XXXX, since I instead paid in full online. In error and unknown to me, XXXX XXXX XXXX put a permanent stop pay on all future XXXX XXXX payments. Nobody ever contacted me from XXXX XXXX to alert me of any payment issue 's. 

In XX/XX/2018, I again contacted XXXX XXXX for my balance & again made the payment in full online. Once again, XXXX XXXX did NOT alert me to the XXXX XXXX XXXX stop payment issue, and allowed me to believe my account was in good standing as it always was. I went online and paid that amount in full, and believed my account to be in good standing. At which time, my credit score was XXXX. 

I come to find out in XX/XX/XXXX, after being denied a car loan- that XXXX XXXX had been reporting my payments as 120 days in default! In fact, the bank that denied my loan was XXXX XXXX XXXX! I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and inquired why my payments were being reported as in default. It was at this time that XXXX XXXX stated they had not received a payment since XX/XX/XXXX, and all monthly payments since that time had been stopped by XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX had closed my account. Consequentially, my credit score was now XXXX!!!!! I spoke with multiple representatives and three different supervisors at XXXX XXXX to discuss and correct this issue. Each time, I was told a different story, and each time was told the issue was with my bank- XXXX XXXX XXXX . It took dozens of phone calls to XXXX XXXX to find out exactly what happened with my payments, and what I needed to do in order for XXXX XXXX to re-open my account, and correct the default payments which would then ( hopefully ) fix my credit score. XXXX XXXX stated they needed a letter from my bank on their letterhead, stating it was their ( XXXX ) error. This letter was sent to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/18. 

Since this time, I have contacted XXXX XXXX weekly. Each time, I have been told they DID NOT receive the letter! XXXX XXXX has continued to report my payments as derogatory, which has continued to destroy my credit. On XX/XX/2018, I spoke to another XXXX XXXX supervisor whom informed me they DID receive the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX and have everything they need in order to re-open my account and update my payment history. I was told I would receive a letter confirming this had been done within 7 business days. Today, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/2018- stating they want ANOTHER letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX . XXXX XXXX has REFUSED to correct this error. They are still reporting to all three credit agencies that I have been 120 days in default since XX/XX/2018. They have DESTROYED my credit!

Additionally, NewRez has no message portal where users can view their sent and received messages, and their mortgage servicing department can't even see the messages you sent!

Mortgage,"I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for unfair and deceptive practices in handling my mortgage loan modification and foreclosure process, in violation of RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ), the Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR, Cal.

These actions have caused me severe distress, prevented me from curing my arrears, and put my home of over 15 years at risk of wrongful foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Timeline of Events : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  : I paid {$160000.00} via XXXX XXXX XXXX to cure arrears, but Shellpoint continued foreclosure without crediting it properly. 
Ongoing since XXXX : I've sent 30+ certified debt validation requests ( latest XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ) under FDCPA and XXXX XXXX XXXX blocking my ability to refinance/sell ( property appraised at $ XXXX with equity ). Name errors persist ( using "" XXXX '' despite XXXX change notifications ).

But on a call XX/XX/XXXX, she rudely claimed I was already denied, contradicting a letter I received stating my "" full package '' is under active review ( attached ). This is dual-tracking : advancing foreclosure while reviewing a complete application. 
XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  : Shellpoint verbally confirmed to me they placed the XX/XX/XXXX sale "" on hold. '' XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( trustee ) emailed confirming the file is "" currently on hold as per Shellpoint 's instructions, '' but postponement will only happen "" closer to the sale date '' once formal instructions arrive ( attached email chain ). Their foreclosure attorney left a voicemail and sent email verifying the hold in writing. 
XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  : Followed up with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX replied they'll "" immediately postpone '' once Shellpoint instructs, but no update yet ( attached ). Despite this, public records still show the sale as active, creating confusion and panic. Shellpoint 's XXXX XXXX previously ( XXXX  ) gave "" incorrect guidance '' to ignore the NOD, leading to a denied mod after months of reviewadmitted internally as needing "" coaching '' ( prior complaint evidence ). 

Shellpoint 's inconsistent communication ( hold confirmed but not formalized ; mod "" under review '' vs. "" denied '' ) violates RESPA 's requirement for timely, accurate responses ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.36 ) and HBOR 's ban on dual-tracking ( Cal.

Impact on Me : I'm a homeowner in XXXX, CA, fighting to save my family 's home amid health/financial hardships. These delays have blocked refinancing/sale options, spiked my stress ( sleepless nights, XXXX  ), and cost thousands in legal fees.

I told them I would prefer they send me this in writing via mail before I make such a big payment to a company I 've never received anything from or heard of.

I waited a few weeks and never received anything, so I called the company back, to be told I would now have to pay {$900.00} to settle the date. I explained to the young lady that I had called recently and they was suppose to send me something in the mail, but I never got anything. So she said she would send me something and I can call them back once I receive the letter to start making payments. Once again, I never received anything, at this point I am fed up, so I call the original company that I owe which is XXXX, they apologized for the inconvenience but said I would have to go through this company to pay the debt, so they transferred me back to AllianceOne.

She said that every time I call back they up the price. I explained to her that I have called numerous times in the attempt to receive something in writing from their company and that I would not make such a big payment over the phone to a company that I have no knowledge of. She began to become very rude, saying that their company does not work like that and they would not be sending me anything and that I would have to make a payment today or the debt would remain on my credit.

Mortgage,"I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for multiple serious servicing errors related to my mortgage loan # XXXX, secured by my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. These issues include a potentially invalid loan transfer that breaks the chain of title, an unauthorized interest rate increase, non-responsiveness from my assigned Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ), and an improper non-judicial foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. I believe these violations contravene the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), Regulation X ( including 12 CFR 1024.40 ), and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR, including Civil Code 2924.11 ). Given the imminent foreclosure datejust weeks awayI urgently request CFPB intervention to prevent irreversible harm, such as the loss of my home. 
My loan originated on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) for {>= $1,000,000}. It was modified effective XX/XX/XXXX, via a Modification Agreement recorded in XXXX XXXX, California ( Instrument No. XXXX ). This modification was intended to be securitized into a trust in XXXX. However, I recently discovered the loan was not transferred into the trust until XXXX years later and likely well beyond the XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) cutoff date. This delay may render the assignment void under New York trust law ( which commonly governs these XXXX ), thereby breaking the chain of title and calling into question Shellpoint 's standing to service or foreclose on the loan. California courts have consistently upheld borrowers ' rights to challenge such void assignments, as established in landmark cases like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
The loan was modified by XXXX XXXX XXXX with a 2 % interest rate to stabilize my payments and prevent delinquency. Without my consent, proper notice, or any justification, Shellpoint, as the current servicer, unilaterally raised the rate to 3.5 %, leading to higher monthly payments, accumulated arrears, and potential overcharges. This increase may be entirely invalid due to the flawed XXXX transfer, which could void Shellpoint 's authority to make any changes, and it appears to breach the original modification agreement. Shellpoint has a documented history of mishandling loan modifications and rate adjustments, as evidenced by numerous CFPB complaints and a XXXX CFPB settlement requiring {$3.00} million in principal reductions for similar issues involving improper rate adjustments and servicing errors. The unauthorized rate hike has exacerbated my financial hardship, inflated my arrears, and resulted in overpayments for which I am owed a full refund, including interest on those amounts. 
Additionally, Shellpoint assigned me XXXX XXXX as a XXXX under XXXX and Regulation X to facilitate discussions on loss mitigation options. However, XXXX XXXX has been consistently non-responsive and hostile in prior interactions, as evidenced by the attached email chain from XX/XX/XXXX, where she repeatedly directed me to submit disputes in writing without addressing my concerns and stated that the loan was not assigned to a XXXXCcontradicting Shellpoint 's obligations. On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX XXXX  I emailed XXXX XXXX requesting immediate assistance with the pending foreclosure sale. I also emailed the Loss Mitigation Department to confirm her status as my XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have received no response whatsoever from either, in clear violation of requirements for an accessible, knowledgeable, and responsive XXXX This non-responsiveness and apparent hostility have severely hindered my ability to explore viable alternatives to foreclosure, such as a new loan modification, forbearance, or repayment plan, and demonstrate a pattern of poor service that makes continued assignment to XXXX XXXX untenable. 
Despite these unresolved servicing errors and my ongoing attempts to engage in loss mitigation, Shellpoint has proceeded with scheduling a non-judicial foreclosure sale for XX/XX/XXXX. This action is wrongful and premature given the chain-of-title defects, interest rate errors, lack of XXXX communication, and potential invalidity of XXXX servicing actions. Under XXXX, the sale must be postponed if a complete loss mitigation application is under review or if servicing errors remain unaddressed. Furthermore, on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Notice of Error/Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) via certified mail, demanding corrections, documentation, and a response within the statutorily required timelinesyet I have received no acknowledgment or substantive reply. Shellpoint 's records currently indicate that to bring my loan current, I would need to pay approximately {$180000.00} in arrears, an amount that is artificially inflated by the unauthorized rate increase, related fees, and unapplied payments stemming from these errors. 
These cumulative violations have caused significant stress, emotional distress, potential overpayments, credit harm, lost equity and opportunity costs, and the imminent threat of losing my home. Shellpoint 's practices align with widespread consumer complaints about deceptive foreclosures, rate mishandling, poor customer service, and systemic failures in complying with federal and state regulations. I request immediate CFPB investigation and enforcement to halt these unfair practices and provide relief."
Debt collection,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Request for Fair Settlement and Resolution To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally address the ongoing issues I have experienced while attempting to resolve Case. Since my initial contact, I have been transparent about my financial hardship due to undergoing XXXX treatment. Despite these circumstances, I have been met with inflexibility, intimidation, and what I believe to be disrespectful treatment from your representatives. 

Over the course of several communications, I have consistently expressed my willingness to settle my account. Most recently, on XX/XX/year>, I again reached out with the intention of resolving both associated accounts through a lump sum payment, provided that the additional 30 % that was added to the original debt could be removed as part of a mutual agreement. 

During this conversation, the representative told me they would accept the payment and later send a letter indicating full payment had been received. However, I was also informed, rather abruptly and without empathy, that they could not guarantee that any existing judgment would be addressed or reversedeven after payment. The tone and demeanor of the representative were unprofessional and dismissive, despite my efforts to settle the matter in good faith."
Debt collection,"I am disputing an alleged XXXX XXXX Bank credit card debt that XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to own. I previously disputed this debt with the credit bureaus. It was deleted from one bureau but remains on the others as verified.

On XX/XX/year>, I received a text message from a company called XXXX XXXX regarding an alleged debt. I called to clarify and recorded the call. During the call, the agent stated that the account was from XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX for a XXXX XXXX Bank credit card. When I stated I did not recognize the debt and requested validation, the agent hung up on me mid-conversation. 

This is a violation of the FDCPA, which requires debt validation upon request. Further, XXXX continues to report this debt on my credit file even though they have sold or transferred it, which is misleading and inaccurate under the FCRA. 

I am requesting that XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX immediately delete this tradeline from all credit reporting agencies and cease collection activities, as they no longer own this debt and have failed to properly validate it."

I have two other credit bureaus that I check and they have separate reports than Experian. On those accounts, it shows the delinquency was resolved and removed from the report.

He then said that he was going to call me however many times he felt like calling. I hung up the phone. He called again and I recorded the conversation. This time, he proceeded to include information about a phone number and a case number I could call to retrieve more information and he hung up. Not sure why I need to call a number to retrieve more information after he harassed me with XXXX phone calls.

Mortgage,"I had a Covid relief forbearance. I was approved for a modification when that ended. I have the final notarized copy of the modification from SPS and have made two payments. My first payment was due before XX/XX/22, I made a {$1100.00} on XX/XX/22 for that payment. Watching the status of my account online I noticed after XXXX that payment was not posted and applied to my account. On XX/XX/22 when my account still showed a XXXX payment due I made another payment of {$970.00} so my account wouldn't be past due and jeopardize the modification. SPS posted the {$970.00} payment to my account but have not posted the {$1100.00}. I have called SPS four times regarding this and the only response I get is "" they haven't processed my modification yet ''. I spoke to a supervisor who sent an escalation to Cashiering to have my payment processed. According to the statement I've received it is still "" not applied ''. I'm sure SPS is making interest on my {$1100.00} they have been holding since XX/XX/22. I should be paid the interest. Also, had my {$1100.00} payment posted when I paid it, it would have reduced my principal and saving me some interest for the next month. I called again on XX/XX/22, still no updates, the representative was rude and unhelpful. I called to set up reoccurring monthly payments and she talked in circles asking me what I wanted to do. I explained reoccurring payments. I got nowhere with her. I asked for a supervisor. She placed me on hold for at least 14 mins and came back to tell me she and her manager looked at my account and couldn't set up a reoccurring payment until a code was removed. She avoided letting me speak to a supervisor or manager. But she told me a reoccurring payment was set up but I needed to call in monthly for 6 months to pay by phone. I asked for the manager and after on hold several more minutes I hung up. Yesterday I spent 30 mins on the phone with SPS and accomplished nothing! Just like all the other calls!"

Debt collection,"About XXXX  years ago I financed a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  from a XXXX dealership in Colorado. At the time it was privately owned but sold out XXXX  years ago so they don't have my documents. I had the car for XXXX month and called and told the dealership I could not pay for the car and told them to pick the car up and take it back. After the month I had the car I was in impound and I provided the company with the address so they could come get it. I never drove the vehicle again and it had no damage at all. It was a volunteered repossession. 

I now love in arkansas and have since then. I was never contacted by mail, phone or email about the car or a debt or even knew I had a debt until a few months ago when it showed up on my XXXX  account. Once I saw the debt it was for over {$24000.00} but the original price to finance the vehicle with interest after my trade in was around {$16000.00} or less. 

I found the original creditor was kino financial in Arizona and I attempted to call them and left several messages but never got a response. So I contacted the debt collector XXXX XXXX and associates in texas. This was the first point of contact and during this phone call I was threatened by them to take legal action against me. I asked them to email me documentation and they never did. This was a few months ago In XXXX. I then called a second time about XXXX weeks or so ago and attempted to resolve this debt. During the first couple minutes of the phone call I was again threatened with legal action. I tried to explain the situation and that the debt amount is wrong. I also disputed it twice on my TransUnion account. I even attempted to settle the debt on a payment plan and was told that if they reduced it to {$16000.00} I would have to pay it in full. 

I then called the the XXXX dealerships XXXX  XXXX and he gave me information and told me to ask for certain documents including who the car was sold to and for how much because that amount should be deducted from the debt as well as that the debt should not be {$8000.00} more then the original price of the car. 

After that I called XXXX and rush again asking for documentation. They said they would send them. I also emailed them for the specific documents I was requesting and told them I will not be paying them the XXXX and that I'm not financially capable of paying a lump sum of money as well. They then emailed me some documents and a very limited amount. Not only was part of the documents inaccurate but they still have not sent me information on what happened to the car after I returned it despite me asking multiple times. I sent another email asking for the addition documentation and have not received a response. 

Since that phone call Williams rush and associates ran a hard inquiry on my Experian account witch significantly dropped my credit score. I did not give them permission to do to so and at that point they already had my email, phone number and address and I had been in contact with them. They had no right to run a hard Inquiry or any legitimate reason.

I am desperately trying to take care of this debt but the amount is wrong by thousands of dollars and the debt collector is using coercive tactics and threats to get me to pay something I do not owe from 6 years ago. This is preventing me from being able to get my family into a home even through a low income program. 

My other concern is the documents they sent me show that I had the car for a year and that is not true and I relinquished the car after about a month of having it. Also that they refuse to accommodate in anyway or provide documents showing the car was sold and for how much. I am not even aware of what contracts I signed and XXXX documents does not look like my signature. I will attach a few documents of emails between me and the company and what documents they sent me."

Debt collection,"I am filing this complaint regarding Resurgent Capital Services. I have filed an identity theft report and have spoken with Resurgent Capital Services twice regarding an alleged debt they claim I owe. 

I specifically requested an original copy of the contract or documentation from the original creditor proving that I owe this balance. Instead, they have repeatedly sent only an account summary, which does not satisfy the validation requirements under federal law. 

Violations of U.S. Code : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( FDCPA ) : Requires that, upon written dispute, a debt collector must provide proper validation of the debt, not merely an account summary.

Debt collection,"Two day ago I talked to another XXXX  employee of Wells Fargo Bank who had never been trained to underwrite a VA HAMP modification and as a result he understand did not the requires of the program of XX/XX/XXXX, VA Circular 26-10-02 that was a modification for Dept of VA loans that was a 40yr term with interest rates as low as 2 % interest rates. 

This XXXX XXXX  XXXX  I was talking to brought up a standard trick and said that I did not supply updated financials for the modification that they never started as they stopped processing VA loan for HAMP at some point in XXXX, which they received my financial documents on or about XX/XX/XXXX. Wells used the tactic of saying that homeowners did not supply them with financial document when they were actually receiving the information, when in fact it was received on or about XX/XX/XXXX, which Wells admits to receiving and admit to not processing the loan, and as the information of my wife nor my income changed and the new VA HAMP would have accepted the financials already received to be used in the underwriting of the XX/XX/XXXX effective date VA HAMP.

Wells wants to use that financial were not updated when in fact they did not start processing VA HAMP until after XX/XX/XXXX. Updated information was supplied to Wells personnel XXXX before the foreclosure as it was send directly to her computer which a conformation was received, however she did not admit to receiving it! However, it did not matter because Wells was not processing any Dept of VA loan for the VA HAMP at the time. 

Also this XXXX I was talking to a couple of days ago from Wells about this latest response, telling me I had not provided Wells with updated financials but he never read XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, "" Evidence of Income '' That says that, The income evidence and financial information provided by the borrower may not be more than 90 days old as of the Initial Package is receive by the servicer. The initial package was received by Wells on XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, which would have had an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX, yet the foreclosure was XX/XX/XXXX, plus the fact that the financial update was fax to XXXX XXXX before the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure. 

So the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) understanding these facts and awarded me {$6000.00}, however, the issue of one of the initial payoff category in "" No Standing '' was deleted from the final agreement in XX/XX/XXXX, and homeowners were told to take the matter up on your on and receipt of any payouts has no bearing on future settlement on the No Standing. 

By not granting me a VA HAMP modification as with the several thousand of bankruptcy victims in the two class actions brought by XXXX and XXXX who were protected by TARP as military families not granted a VA HAMP. So as the Dept of VA was criminal violated by Wells so was I as my property was sold as my equity from month mortgage payments and the fact that XXXX could not complete the mortgage loan contract after XX/XX/XXXX, because they stopped existing and neither XXXX  XXXX, Wells Fargo Bank or XXXX XXXX purchase the loan debt, means they had no financial interest in the loan! 

Wells will not provide a document that sold the mortgage loan because one does not exist and they have no financial receipt of a payment made. XXXX purchase my loan on XX/XX/XXXX, and did not receive from XXXX XXXX XXXX  the required Assignment of Deed of Trust they were required to create and have delivered to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the point of sale. XXXX address the failure by XXXX XXXX XXXX  who later recorded a Power of Attorney ( XXXX ) as to failing to create Assignment per correspondent agreement between the two and was not recorded until Wells was at the end of transferring a XXXX of XXXX 's XXXX XXXX pooled from XX/XX/XXXX through mid XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX the POA was recorded at XXXX XXXX. 

Understand that Wells is not working as servicer for XXXX after XX/XX/XXXX, because the XXXX does not exist! On XX/XX/XXXX Wells had the Assignment of Deed of Trust XXXX signed by the outside law firm in XXXX XXXX XXXX that employee attorney XXXX XXXX acting as Assistance Secretary for XXXX  as if XXXX  has a financial interest and working for a active member of XXXX  which XXXX was not. The trick was to act as if XXXX XXXX was still a financially interest party and say they were transferring to Wells as if Wells purchased the loan when in fact they did not. 

There is not need for Wells to ever be place as the "" holder in due course '' when they are not the owner, as there no requirement for the owner bank to personally appear just as Wells was not personally at the foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX  I talked to a couple days ago fails to understand that XXXX XXXX is never the originator, seller or buyer of a home mortgage loan, yet this XXXX said to me that from the beginning XXXX XXXX is the owner/investor of my loan. XXXX was never told that all Dept of VA loans originated by a bank is done with the bank 's private funds and only does XXXX get involved is when a bank XXXX pools the loan. The XXXX  does not understand that the originator is not authorize XXXX XXXX to pool VA loans and it not until XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX is involved as the insure of the securities only! XXXX XXXX is not funded by the US Government to fund mortgage loans and can not at the beginning of this as he has stated be involved with my loan. Not all VA loans are XXXX pooled but 96 % are pooled but this is done after the after the loans are funded by the lender and then submitted for pooling underwriting as my loan was underwritten on XX/XX/XXXX and accepted into XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX! 

So here we are again with Wells having to pay up to {$2.00} XXXX for abuses of Mortgage customers according to XXXX XXXX Update, and because of the two class actions they seen that the military families were also protected under XXXX when we were not granted VA HAMP during XXXX as part of the victims in XXXX and XXXX! 

One more thing is the XXXX at Wells did not understand Circular XXXX The VA HAMP refunding program provides for a fixed interest rate, with a floor of two percentage for the life of the loan ; a maximum term of up to 40 years ; and principal deferment when appropriate."

Debt collection,"In XXXX, I applied for credit towards some XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. This was done at my then primary dentists office, and it was provided through CareCredit. I was completely fine with the terms, as long as I eventually received the product. I was well aware I would not receive the product immediately and may still have to make payments, so I did for the first few months. Through that time I moved, but made sure to keep in contact very well with the company, to ensure that I would eventually get my product. Well, there was minimum effort to get the product to me, and constant miscommunication between internal workers at said company. For months and eventually more than a year, there was constant miscommunication on the state of my product, and little to no effort to actually resolve it. So, since I didnt receive my product I stopped making payments. I kept trying to resolve this internally with the company but there was no resolve, just more and more negative impact on my credit for a product I DONT HAVE. This lasted from XXXX all the way to XX/XX/XXXX, when I got fed up and made an internal dispute with CareCredits customer service team. The lady I spoke had let me know the call will be recorded and I agreed to said terms. I let her know of the situation exactly how I explained it before, and what she proceeded to let me know whats that she had submitted the dispute, and that I should expect a written notice of said dispute within the next 60 days of the call, which would be sent to my address at the time. Well, I never received it. I lived at that address long after the 60 days, hoping to get that letter, and I just never received it. It is also worth noting that I have not heard from the XXXX XXXX company in such a long time. I dont even care about the product anymore, this is affecting my credit. This is literally my life. The company did not uphold their part of the contract, have been terrible in contacting me, and Im stuck to clean it up.

Mortgage,"Continued noncompliance and suspicious activity from Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage Department. Please reference CFPB complaints XXXX and XXXX. 

After receiving the continuous emails from NFCU concerning a revised disclosure after my last complaint, I noticed a change in the loan officer assigned to my account. Not understanding, I reached out, and ask this person who they were and why are they now on my account. The response I received was that she was here to help with the complaints. 

That did not occur and its not occurring at all. Although she is very nice, her goal of trying to get me to use Navy Federal as my lender, in my belief to put suspicion on these complaints ( e.g. if I use them as a lender then how could they have done the things that Im accusing them of doing ), had nothing to do with resolving the complaints themselves. In fact, I was provided new and INCORRECT documentation in the form of loan estimates where a rate lock was applied because she had mentioned that it was something she could take care of. New documents were sent and they attempted to charge me for a lock but neglected to mark the correct boxes stating so. Also points were applied but no discount or viable explanation was given as to why I would be paying a higher rate, for a lock, that is not indicated on the loan estimate sheet. When I brought this to her attention, she eventually provided a loan estimate sheet that appears to be filled out properly, however it continues to support my belief of nefarious practices within NFCU. IF these are your best people and these are the people you have assigned to try to rectify any of the issues we have, then why are you still trying to price gouge me by applying a rate much higher than what I was quoted before, stating that because I did not lock at the time that any interest rate that increased is my responsibility to pay but neglect to note the reasons why such as your inability to explain what these rates are in a level where I can understand, and the bigger issue of your discriminatory practices! Then NFCU still presents their negligence and unwillingness to properly resolve any issues in the form of sending improperly filled out paperwork. NFCU should be required to explain why they are STILL sending improperly filled out documentation where for obvious reasons they are attempting to charge me for points and rate locks that they cant seem to figure out on their own in-house sheets. We can pretend, and keep calling these mistakes, but at what point are we going to call it what it is? Especially when Im being told these are your people to help resolve the issue so I must assume that they are the best people you can find to contact me. In their thinly veiled attempt to silence my complaints, Navy Federal is STILL trying to charge extra money one way or the other. Their actions continue to support my original complaint that there is something nefarious going on within their mortgage department and they have no desire or possibly ability to correct."

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time I will also inform that if offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, Equifax or XXXX } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws.

Sending out a generic form through the XXXX system that doesnt even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable.

Which Im sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court.

I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you.

Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when it fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : Equifax, XXXX  and XXXX } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit.

Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, a loan Consultant from NationStar started a loan application to do an FHA streamline refinance, she gave me a rate and pressured me to lock it.

Nationstar sent a letter to my house claiming I requested a payoff of {$320000.00} dollars and must be paid in full of the end of this month. I never made such request. I believed this was done because I was shopping around for a better deal. I attempted to refinance again in order to determine if this was a pattern with Nationstar, and spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. he informed he was not able to pull my credit because I have a freeze on my Credit Score. I knew this was a lie because I lifted the Freeze for 30 days. When a loan application was originated by XXXX XXXX, I noticed a XXXX XXXX, 2015 date on the application before the agreement will become null and void. I call him and he explained that he must used the previous date that XXXX XXXX had started because I had locked the rate. This was a lie. He told me instead of 60 days, I will have 45 days to complete the application. I review the application and forward it to XXXX XXXX. I sent over all required documentation except for the Home Insurance Declaration Page. When I contacted my insurance company XXXX, which is affiliated with XXXX, they informed me that my insurance was cancelled due to the fact they did not received payment.

The only one I received was with XXXX, XXXX, which required payment from me and not through an escrow. I refused because it was Nationstar who made the mistake. Because of Nationstar, I 'm not able to refinance with them or any other company before I have home insurance. They have ruined my name because I can not get home insurance. To matter worse, they sent me a letter on XXXX XXXX, 2015 threatening to place a high premium insurance on the house and lied and stated that I had informed them that I was going to pay Home Insurance directly. To avoid the high premium, I decided to go with XXXX and paid out my pocket {$1200.00}, which is more than I paid before of {$850.00} with XXXX.

Mortgage,"We received a letter from our mortgage lender, Caliber Home Loans, posted XX/XX/2022 in regards to our request for assistance. The letter was as arranged repayment agreement made between Caliber and my husband and I to bring our account current since we were unable to make payments for two months due to income reduction. The letter stated "" The total Arrearage Amount due as of XX/XX/2022 is {$1000.00} ... the specific conditions of the agreement are as follows : XXXX. The first payment in the amount of {$920.00} shall be remitted ... on or before XX/XX/2022 XXXX. A subsequest repayment plan monthly payment is due on XX/XX/2022, in the amount of {$1300.00}... 
XXXX. Your scheduled repayment plan monthly payment is comprised of your current monthly payment of {$920.00}, and the supplemental montly payment in the amount of {$440.00}. 
XXXX. The scheduled repayment plan monthly payment shall remain at {$1300.00} effective XX/XX/2022 and will end on XX/XX/2022 ... '' Upon agreement, we made these three consecutive payments, one in a slightly larger amount of {$1100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, one for the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and finally the last payment of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. During this process we continued to receive statements showing that we were behind on our payments and I was assured that we were on target, that sometimes the computer system does not recognize the updated payments during a repayment plan. I called multiple times during these months to make sure my payment had been received and that starting in XXXX our monthly payments moving forward would be {$860.00}. By the end of XXXX when I paid my payment of {$860.00}, I was still getting calls that we were 30 days past due on our account. On XX/XX/XXXX, our loan officailly transferred to XXXX XXXX  after being aquired by XXXX. Since then, I have been on the phone a number of hours with XXXX trying to get answers on why we continue to be in default on our mortgage. If anyone could listen in on the recorded calls I've had regarding the situation, he or she would realize just how many "" answers '' I got from Caliber and XXXX members that led down one rabbit hole after another. FINALLY, after my conversation this week ( Januarly XXXX ) with a XXXX  loss mitigation associate, I believe I received the answer to the problem, which brings me to filing this complaint. 

Upon looking at the arranged repayment plan, the associate easily discovered that Caliber miscalculated the amounts of the payments required for the months of XXXX through XXXX that would have brought our account current by the said date, XX/XX/XXXX. As stated above, this miscalculation of required payments has caused our account to be over 30 days past due for over half a year and has been a hard hit on my husbands credit score. This associate I talked with said there's nothing XXXX can do at this point since Caliber is no longer our mortgage lender. 

According to the repayment plan, we met ALL regulations stated in the agreement and Caliber is at fault for the discrepancy in calculating the amounts that were due."

Debt collection,"RE : Formal Dispute Midland Credit Management Collection ( Acct # : XXXX ) To Whom It May Concern, This is a formal dispute of the information being reported on my credit file regarding a Midland Credit Management account ( Acct # : XXXX ). The account is listed as a collection account with a past due balance of {$4100.00} and a date opened of XX/XX/XXXX, with recent updates as of XX/XX/XXXX. 
This account is being disputed on the following legal grounds : 1. Unverifiable Debt Buyer Status FCRA 1681i & 1692g ( b ) Midland Credit Management is a third-party debt buyer. They are not the original creditor, and no documentation has been provided to verify the chain of title, legal right to collect, or original account details.

2. Account Reporting During a Declared Disaster FCRA 1681c & CARES Act This account reflects deferment from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  to XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  due to a natural or declared disaster. Reporting negative or collection activity during that period may violate federal regulations and consumer protection laws. 
3. Inaccurate and Potentially Re-aged Reporting FCRA 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) The account shows a date opened in XX/XX/XXXX, which is after the deferment period began suggesting re-aging of the debt or improper date assignment. 
4. Lack of Validation Documentation FDCPA 809 ( b ) As required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a debt buyer must provide proper validation of the debt, including the original creditor name, amount, contract, and payment history. This has not been provided. 
DEMAND : I am requesting a full reinvestigation of this account. If Midland Credit Management can not produce full validation, including the original contract and itemized billing history, this account must be permanently deleted from my credit file. Please provide written confirmation of the reinvestigation results within 30 days."

Debt collection,On XX/XX/19 I filed a complaint about pro collect in search for something as simple as a receipt for a {$550.00} payment that was made on XX/XX/19. This morning a representative Ms XXXX I believe her name was called me in her attempt to rectify the situation. However she did not give me any option for a receipt my only options were to pay the balance in full for a paid in full letter or to use my statements. This is not an official receipt! How am I to prove that I have paid you or what my balance is on the account if I do not have a statement. the rep continued to ask me with her harsh tone if I wanted to cancel the payment plan that I did not want to set up in the first place but was told I had to because they do not accept partial payments it has to be on a plan. I told her if I can not receive a receipt or documentation on the plan yes please cancel. She then told me that my balance for BOTH of my accounts are now due in full. This is not fair as the account that had the plan has nothing to do with the other account as they are two separate accounts. This is an unfair attempt for retaliation and I think they need to be investigated for their policy and tactics as a financial collection service. I had not problem paying them back until I was told that I would not receipt the appropriate documentation until I give them all of the money. The rep then asked me if I have received any of their attempts to collect ( which she knows I did not because I changed my address in the system with her when I made the initial payment ) she then told me she can send a bill for the balance of both of the accounts to my address on file. You mean to tell me you can not send me a receipt or proof of payment but you can send me a bill and request for payment of debt?

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Hi, for the past 4 months I've been going back and forth the credit reporting agencies regarding these accounts in question and the reason for this is because I know that these accounts are being reported incorrectly. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 609 ) it is my right to challenge any account in my credit if I believe they are being reported inaccurate, unverifiable or incomplete. I believe they are and some of them have been corrected on some of the bureaus and some have not. I would like to make this complaint to show the level of urgency I have towards this matter. If you can please help I would really appreciate it. These accounts have to be deleted since they are holding my credit scores back and I'm looking to use my credit soon to make a major purchase. Thanks!

Mortgage,"United Wholesale Mortgage ( UWM ) refinanced my home on XX/XX/XXXX. Included within the refinance was an escrow account to cover my homeowners insurance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was notified by my homeowners insurance that my payment was past due and not yet received. At that point I submitted a request via UWM 's secure website asking why payment had not been made and that I was unable to determine that they had made payment via their website. 

I received a secure message back on XX/XX/XXXX from them stating that I can update my insurance information via a secure portal and they provided instructions to do so. As my insurance had not changed, and was still the same information they had on their online portal I determined this was an inappropriate response. 

Instead of moving forward with "" changing '' my insurance information, I instead chose to call their XXXX main phone number for support later that day on XX/XX/XXXX. At that point, a gentleman stated that he too saw that my escrow account included homeowners insurance. He stated that the first payment they had indicated was for XX/XX/XXXX. I stated that as my home refinance closed in XX/XX/XXXX, and that UWM knew my insurance was up for renewal in XXXX, as determined by the XX/XX/XXXX due date, UWM should be aware that a payment was needed in XX/XX/XXXX. He agreed and said he would reach out to the insurance department for more information and call me back on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I did not receive a call on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I did not receive a call on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called UWM back on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. At that point I spoke with a XXXX who claimed that as the homeowners insurance was not funded at the time of closing this was not UWM 's fault. I stated that insurance was included within the escrow and she agreed. She then stated that UWM making this payment would impact my future escrow calculation. I stated that I understand that UWM made a mistake, but that the insurance must still be paid. I was comfortable with my escrow adjusting to make up for this error as these were still my funds to pay. As such, XXXX provided me with instructions on how to submit a bill to UWM via an email address and that a check would be overnighted to pay for my homeowners insurance that at this point was more than a week past due. I followed those instructions within the hour on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX and requested confirmation in the email for when the payment was sent. 

I did not hear back on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

On the evening of Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a reply to the auto-response email that I received on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX from when I sent them the bill stating that if I did not hear back about payment being sent by noon on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX that I would be initiating this complaint with the CPFB. 

I still have not heard back and am unable to tell that my homeowners insurance has been paid. I don't understand how UWM can hold my escrow account hostage and not pay these bills."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",I have disputed the inaccurate reporting of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX several times.They are reporting that I owe {$130.00} to XXXX. I do not owe XXXX and this is inaccurate information. XXXX is reporting this false information to Credit Bureaus under different names also. Under XXXX it is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and Equifax XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The investigation into this inaccurate account has been less than adequate.
Mortgage,"In XXXX of 2025 we refinanced our house and got a mortgage of {$170000.00}. Our mortgage company is Loancare. Had a insurance claim on our home for water damage through XXXXXXXX XXXX where we were issued an {$80000.00} insurance claim. They gave us a check for {$74000.00} ( these numbers and dates XXXX be estimated ). We had to send the check from XXXX XXXX to Loancare so they could administer the funds as seen fit. They said that it usually comes in thirds. They send out an initial check once you prove documentation. Then they send out a second check after an inspection has been done. Once the work is finished they give you a third check. We submitted all documents and a request for all funds released. 

My husband took the time off of work to complete the water remediation that needed to be done when the water damage happened to prevent mold. We are now a month out from the damage and we have not seen a cent. We overnighted the check XX/XX/2025. We submitted the paperwork on XX/XX/XXXX. We were told that all paperwork was accepted XX/XX/XXXX. Then that a check should be released on Monday the XXXX. We are now here at Wednesday the XXXX and they are still trying to tell me that my my documents ( insurance adjuster sheet specifically ) is not accepted. Yet again, on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to someone in the escalations department and they looked at the the paperwork and they said that it was all there and that we were clear and we would have an answer by tonight whether we would be getting XXXX check or release of full funds. A hope of atleast something. We are majority owners in the home. We own approximately 80 %. We have cared for this home for the last 18 months we've been here. We put on a new roof. We ripped out the old driveway and installed a new driveway. We removed over an acre of trees. We have shown a commitment to caring for our property. Now we are sitting in an almost XXXX dollar home with plywood for flooring. They are saying that we need to provide this documentation which we have. When I tell them I would like to go to the next step. Since we already completed water and mediation and we need money to order flooring. They tell me that we can not move forward because we didn't complete the first step. Then they keep telling me that it'll be XXXX to XXXX business days, XXXX to XXXX business days and for that I don't even know if that's when the check 's actually going to be released. That's just when they're going to make a decision possibly whether we can get our first check or not. 

I have XXXX small children XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I'm trying to get this done and it is inhumane that they are not releasing our funds. 

I recently checked their reviews and saw multiple reviews that said that they either had their insurance claims never given to them or that they had to fully fund their fix while they held on to the check. I want the full amount of money so that I can complete this project and I them to then sell our account. I don't even know if that's something that you guys can get them to do but this company is deplorable."

As of XX/XX/XXXX its still there and the store hung up on me stating maam there is no account nor was one sent to collections because theres nothing to send."
Debt collection,"I entered a consumer credit transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. A completed application with my personal information, my drivers license, and my social security number which is my credit card pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( l ) was required to acquire a XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. That same day XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX knowingly used my completed application, furnished a fictitious contract, and sold it to AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE without my written or oral consent. Since then, AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE has used the fictitious contract to fraudulently collect an alleged from me. I sent AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE a Cease-and-Desist Order ( Green receipt # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XXXX of XXXX after my property was unlawfully repossessed in XXXX of XXXX and I became aware of their deceptive debt collection practices. AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE did not respond to the letters I sent, but they responded to a complaint I submitted. In their response they admitted that XXXX assigned the contract to them and denied all my claims, stated that they will cease calls only, stated that I still owe the alleged debt and attached the contract and all cash payments they have taken from me. After reviewing the attachments, I sent a second Cease-and-Desist Order with a debt validation letter pursuant to 15 USC 1692g ( a ) attached on XX/XX/XXXX ( green receipt # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). In my Cease-and-Desist Order I demanded AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE respond to the attached debt validation letter with any and all exhibits, cease any and all payment collections for this alleged debt, and cease any and all attempts of repossession. AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE confirmed they received both letters by placing stamps on them dated XX/XX/XXXX, and they responded via mail on XX/XX/XXXX, by sending a response letter stating they believe they have enclosed all relevant records which establish the existence and validity of the debt and its assignment to AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE. They also sent back the documents I originally sent stamped and dated XX/XX/XXXX, the completed credit application I submitted with XXXX that they were not present for, the fictitious contract that XXXX illegally sold to them, and a 2-page list of cash payments they took from me since XX/XX/XXXX. Also, since then, they have continued to use false and deceptive debt collection practices to harass, oppress, and abuse me and my family for payment towards the alleged debt. They have ignored my demands and continue to contact me as well as shared my information to multiple third-party companies without my consent. On XX/XX/XXXX, a third party sent on behalf of AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE tried to unlawfully repossess my property for a second time while my family was inside of the vehicle. The third party embarrassed me and my family outside of a XXXX parking lot by hooking our vehicle up to their tow truck, causing a disturbance, making threats towards me and my family, and calling the police on us because we refused to exit the vehicle. This violates the Cease-and-Desist Order I sent on XX/XX/XXXX demanding that AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE cease any and all attempts of collection/communication and any and all attempts of repossession. On XX/XX/XXXX, another third party sent on behalf of AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE showed up at my location at an inconvenient time, did not state who they were, had all my personal information and threatened to repossess my property. My spouse let the agent know that he will not allow for repossession because it is unlawful and that the agent is in violation of federal law for communicating after numerous Cease and Desist Orders were sent to AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE. After several attempts of unlawful repossession and realizing I was refusing to give up my property and that they have violated federal law, on XX/XX/XXXX, AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE suddenly removed their tradeline from my consumer reports. Deletion is admission. I have demanded for AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE to send validation pursuant to 15 USC 1692g ( a ), to provide proof that I in fact am obligated to pay them the alleged debt. They have only provided the contract which has false, misleading, and deceptive information listed throughout and has no benefit to me as a consumer. Pursuant to Federal law this makes the contract null and void. After AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE failed to send validation, any documentary evidence pursuant to 15 USC 49, and continued to harass and abuse me and my family I sent them a third Cease and Desist Order with an Affidavit of Truth, exhibits to support all facts that I stated in my Affidavit of Truth, and an invoice Bill of Particulars via certified mail with green receipt # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. In my Cease and Desist I demanded that AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE grant me my title lien free and pay the attached invoice Bill of Particulars for violating me under the FDCPA. I received a response from AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE via mail on XX/XX/XXXX, with a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating they removed their tradeline from 4 consumer reporting agencies and my Cease-and-Desist Order stamped with the date they received it. Unfortunately, they are still in violation of the FDCPA because they were served a Cease and Desist and confirmed they received it. The FDCPA states in 15 USC 1692c ( c ) that when a debt collector receives a Cease-and-Desist Order they may only contact or communicate with the consumer to state that their further efforts of collection are being terminated and they are invoking the specified remedy the consumer demanded. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE a Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure, a fourth Cease and Desist Order, a second Affidavit of Truth, exhibits proving all facts I stated in my Affidavit of Truth including new ones showing how they have violated me again, another invoice Bill of Particulars with new violations and late fees, and copies of all the documents I previously sent on XX/XX/XXXX. In my Cease-and-Desist Order I demanded that AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE grant me my title lien free and pay the attached invoice Bill of Particulars. I did not enter a credit transaction with AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE and for the past 4 years they have continued to coerce me into paying on a debt that I do not owe them, harass, oppress, and abuse me and my family, caused us emotional damage, defamed my character, harmed my credit worthiness and reputation, and knowingly committed unauthorize use of my credit card, fraud, and aggravated identity theft by taking payments from me, mislead me to think I had contractual obligation to pay them, and furnishing information on my consumer reports without any of my consent. This matter needs to be resolved immediately and I am demanding that AMERICAN CREDIT ACCEPTANCE be held liable for violating me and ignoring the damage I have stated and proved that they have caused me and my family. I have given them plenty of chances to resolve this matter and instead they continue to ignore my demands."

I ca n't understand how I 'm expected to pay {$1400.00} a month, when we bought our home knowing our payment was {$910.00} a month. I have read the explanation on nationstars ' website about the escrow amount going up. Still I can not fathom paying an additional {$430.00} a month. With the company making this change, our best bet to survive as a family will probably have to be to sell our home as we will not be able to make the payment of a nearly 50 % increase on our mortgage."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was charged {$71.00} by XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX I was also charged {$34.00} by the same company. I set it up where this is charged automatically to my Paypal Credit account each year for renewal purposes. With Paypal Credit, individual charges over {$100.00} qualify for a 6-month interest fee special financing program which I have done for years with Paypal on those kinds of purchases. Any amount under {$100.00} do not qualify for that and must be paid before the next billing cycle, or incur high interest charges. I make my payments online and Paypal does not give the option to specify which debt you want to pay towards/off. The site automatically determines that based on which one will be due the soonest. With that being said, since those 2 charges totaling {$100.00} are due before the next billing cycle which is XX/XX/XXXX ( told by one of their representatives when I called about this on XX/XX/XXXX ), I paid the total amount on XX/XX/XXXX. When I checked the account to make sure it was applied to those 2 charges, I saw that it was instead applied to one of the "" special financing '' charges that isn't expired until XX/XX/XXXX. When I called and spoke to a representative, she even agreed that they would normally apply to what is due the soonest which would have been the 2 charges that were under the {$100.00}.

With the new billing cycle being XX/XX/XXXX, I am in no way confident that they will make any attempts to resolve as we all know interest is the way these companies make money and as far as I am concerned, that is the reason they didn't apply my payment as they were supposed to.

Debt collection,"I will continue to return until I receive all the requested documentation and evidence. In my previous complaint, there were 45 questions, and they were not answered in the comprehensive manner I requested. It appears that SAFCO is hiding some truths that they prefer not to reveal to the public, their consumers/customers, and the regulatory authorities overseeing this company. Im not trying to get you to incriminate yourself or exposed your predatory lending practices, all I want is the truth. Is that too much to asked for SAFCO?

I require direct and relevant information regarding my dealings with SAFCO, without any indirect irrelevancy. Please correct me if I'm mistaken and assist me in understanding the lending process. When a buyer approaches a dealership to purchase a vehicle, the dealer is aware that if the buyer lacks sufficient funds, they will likely need financing, correct SAFCO? The dealership acts as the seller but does not possess the funds for the buyer, so they contact their lenders to determine who is willing to provide a loan to the buyer ; this is referred to as indirect lending. Once the dealership identifies a lender willing to finance the required amount, is it accurate to say that the indirect lender is expected to provide the funds to the buyer for the vehicle they wish to purchase? Why are the funds directed to the dealership instead of the buyer? 

In this consumer/financial transaction, the funds were intended to be transferred to the buyer 's demand deposit account rather than the dealership 's account, correct? The funds were meant for me so that I could utilize them to finance the loan check and acquire the vehicle. Did I not have any entitlement to that? I need clarification on this matter. 

The dealership informed me that if SAFCO had provided the funds directly to me and I had chosen to use them for a different purpose instead of buying the vehicle, they would have incurred a loss and faced a greater risk. How is that possible if I intended to use the funds for the vehicle purchase? They seemed to believe that I would seek out a less expensive vehicle and pocket the remaining amount or not getting the vehicle at all. Is that really how you view us consumers? 


What is the process for acquiring my consumer credit information, and what legitimate reasons do you have for continually accessing my data, given that I have not provided SAFCO with any consent for such actions? What permissible purpose you have to continue accessing my data per the Fair Credit Reporting Act? 

SAFCO, you have not adequately validated this purported debt. I have asked for crucial and pertinent information that has not been provided. You continue to upload the same details obtained from an indirect source. 
Where is the documentation from SAFCO that demonstrates a contractual agreement between myself and your company? 

I requested Proof of Assignment and Ownership of the Retail Installment Sales Contract.This documentation shall demonstrate and show the legal transfer of rights from the original seller to the current holder of the contract. This wasnt provided in your statement. 

I requested a copy of SAFCO and XXXX XXXX thats in conjunction with what I have to make sure mines aligned with yours. This wasnt provided to me in your last statement. 


I requested a full detailed itemized fee list to see what hidden fees was imposed on me through this financial transaction. This wasnt provided to me in your last statement. 

What is the process for acquiring my consumer credit information, and what legitimate reasons do you have for continually accessing my data, given that I have not provided SAFCO with any consent for such actions? 
( Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ) SAFCO, you have not adequately validated this purported debt. I have asked for crucial and pertinent information that has not been provided. You continue to upload the same details obtained from an indirect source. Where is the documentation from SAFCO that demonstrates a contractual agreement between myself and your company? 



This purported debt was transferred during the securitization process, so why hasnt SAFCO provided me with evidence that it has the right to collect this debt ( such as a chain of ownership if the debt was sold )? I have not received this information in any of your statements. Please supply me with all the necessary details to confirm whether this alleged debt belongs to me or not. I require additional proof. The more proof I obtain, the less necessity there will be to continue filing complaints against your organization. Where is the verification? 


SAFCO youre engaged in predatory lending and I wouldnt be coming after you but that Usury and Securitization is making your enterprise look very suspicious and abusive. 


SAFCO, you must respond to my inquiries because the truth eventually reveals itself. I have been persistently asking, yet these documents indicate otherwise. I inquired whether this loan was securitized, and you claimed it was not, but the account payment history imply otherwise, particularly the section labeled "" SS Sale of Security. '' How could you be so bold as to lie in front of me and the CFPB?

This is precisely why you hesitate to answer these questions in great dentils ; as it would unveil the fraudulent activities SAFCO is engaging in behind the scenes. Life has taught me that to uncover the truth, one must ask numerous questions, as they will not simply disclose it. Inquiring provides insights and details that can illuminate the darkness, allowing the truth to emerge. Therefore, continue to deny, and I will persist in my questioning to uncover the truth. Records and documents invariably reveal the truth in any circumstance. It is quite straightforward to tell the truth ; once it is revealed, how can one recover from that? This is what renders a person or entities untrustworthy and prompts authorities to scrutinize and investigate companies, like SAFCO. I have observed that corporate America often denies wrongdoing but frequently opts for out-of-court settlements. Why is that? 
If you assert that you are not engaged in any unethical practices, why are you making settlements? Please clarify that for me. These companies consistently pay out while simultaneously denying the truth. This constitutes poor business ethics."
Mortgage,"In 2014, I received a permanent loan modification on my mortgagewith Nationstar upon satisfying my XXXX consecutive trial modificationpayments. At the end of making those payments, I had funds left in asuspense account which amounted to {$1300.00}. It is myunderstanding that according to the Securities Instrument, thatthese funds were supposed to be applied to interest and principalbalance first. I requested that the suspense funds be applied in thisprescribed manner. However, Nationstar took it upon themselves toapply the suspense account funds to my escrow instead, without myknowledge or consent. At that time I was represent by legal counsel, namely, XXXX XXXX XXXX of Delaware, in XXXX, DE, who drafted and submitted a "" Notice of Error '' to Nationstar on mybehalf. To date, there has been no resolution to rectify the misappliedfunds. The Notice of Error clearly demonstrated Nationstar 's blatantdisregard and violation of the protocol set forth by the SecuritiesInstrument as it applies to the allocation of suspense funds. Inaddition, I was promised that my first contractual payment ( postmodification ) would be made from the suspense account. Since mynew payment amount was approximately {$1100.00}, I would have alittle more than {$200.00} left in suspense, which was to applied toward thefollowing month 's payment, for which I would make up the difference. 
It was further agreed upon that I would be notified of the amount ofthat difference payment. Being that none of this came to fruition, Iwas left in a position to have to pay and subsequently becamedelinquent!

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau thoroughly investigate these violations and take appropriate measures to hold the credit bureaus accountable for their noncompliance with consumer protection laws. It is crucial to protect consumers ' rights and ensure fair and accurate credit reporting practices. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution and the restoration of my rights under the FCRA.

Furthermore, I submitted a cease and desist notice under FDCPA 805 ( c ) / 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( c ). Any continued contact without proper validation is considered harassment and a violation of federal law."

Debt collection,"I want to stress that I did not give written permission for these specific transactions to be included in my consumer report. At no point did I authorize these entries, and their presence on my report is unwarranted. Consequently, I am formally requesting that these accounts be blocked and removed from my report immediately. It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end. Instead, this issue arises solely from the fact that I did not explicitly authorize the inclusion of these transactions in my report. I am diligent about maintaining the accuracy and privacy of my financial records, and these unauthorized entries compromise that integrity. I trust that you will handle this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. Please confirm the removal of these transactions from my report as soon as possible.

Mortgage,"At the time of closing escrow, they created such a irresponsible condition to closing the loan. After work with few months with this loan I had no choice but accept even they raised the interest rate within few days of the date of closing. 
{>= $1,000,000} has been held by escrow purpose of paying off loans, some are understandable because they were using to payoff to clear title.But they even held for paying off personal credit card, which were not make any sense. 

Because of this, it cause over payments of near {$100000.00} to credit cards, because I had auto payments set up to pay statement balance, and I couldn't stop these in time. 
Some of over payments are not refunded by credit card company yet as of today, and I am paying interest to this company for that amount in negative in my credit card balance, not benefits me as original purpose, just benefit XXXX banks. 

Also some credit card company not accepting mailed in payments, this cause short payments of {$5000.00} as of this date, which I am claiming now. 

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX this mortgage company try to push XXXX  person to convince me to give up so they don't have to pay me {$5000.00} and recalculate the loan. Her name was XXXX XXXX and when I called her on XXXX, responding to her letter to CFPB, she said she will call me back instead she called couple oXXXX XXXX  agents to take care this issues, she was thinking to put all XXXX in one category to take care this, I assume. Not intention to take care this as what they supposed to.

Not sure why CFPB has closed my 1st complaint, I thought complaint should be addressed before the closing. 

Their action damaged more than just this amount but I can not claim anymore than what's short on total loan amount. 

I am looking for way to revoke their license to loan to the consumer, since they are leading consumers to fail in their life, unethically."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I hired XXXX protection in XXXX to assist me with my credit in XX/XX/2022 because old debt was resold to creditors after already being paid off. 4 letters have gone out to the credit bureaus to rectify the situation.

I also disputed this missing information of my credit card with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX and also nothing happened - see attached a letter. Missing this credit card info from my profile is deeply plunging my credit score and screwed my ability to apply for any loans since it is the oldest card i have."
Mortgage,"Unfortunately this is part 2 of my complaint, the first complaint on XXXX was due to unethical business tactics, lieing to the XXXX program, by claiming I had agreed to a loan modification, which wasn't true. Loancare/Lakeview have yet to reply directly to me in reference to that complain. Instead they decided to retaliate. I was placed back on the forbearence plan, after loancare 's first attempt at foreclosure. I am not due to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX. Why is that my house is again up for preforclosure with no notice, or warning and only 2 days from now? Retaliation for the first complaint. Is that not illegal? For sure it shows a trend of abusing their position in the financial industry. My sister is XXXX of the XXXX XXXX in the jurisdiction she lives in and I am aware that this doesn't fall under her responsibilities, but I don't have many options and will need help from her contacts. Is that unethical? The last thing I want to do is emulate the behavior of loancare. Incidentally when I went through the modification documents, the modification was over a XXXX dollars MORE than it was before this modification. To summarize Loancare was not happy that I had chosen, the program that would put me up to date on my mortgage, giving me not only peace of mind, but some wiggle room. While loancare thought a modification that increased my monthly payment. It was a no brainer. How was I supposed to respond? Oh sure lets go ahead and keep me struggling to make my payments??? I am devastated over this situation. I'm having nightmares over being alone in the middle of nowhere, with nothing no supplies, no food or shelter. I had no idea that this kind of behavior was even possible from a mortgage company. Had I known that the end game was a financial company that obviously thinks I'm to stupid to understand whats happening. I know their role is to lend money and their bread and butter is interest rates. I never would have believed that this kind of tactic would even be considered, much less be implemented into a companies atmosphere. 
As for a fair resolution, that has already been taken from me. I have absolutely no trust at all in this company, I do not see them being fare about anything. The only thing I can see is that Loancare thinks they are above the Treasury, the arizona governor and the protection laws that are in place in regard to forclosure and homelessness prevention. Based on this situation, this company will honor nothing, It's an obvious trend in this companies environment and when it gets to be this blatantly prominent theres nothing left."

American Cordius International has provided no valid documentation of the debt, including no signed lease, no itemized charges, and no proof of ownership or right to collect. The lease they sent contains no signature or date and references a XXXX apartment number. 

This account is not being reported by XXXX  or XXXX XXXXwhich raises questions about its legitimacy.

Equifax also have a wrong address on my credit report. They Also have not corrected that error also. 

Equifax also allows companies to run my credit without proper authorization, and also refuses to removed them. They are the ones also responsible for the breach of my credit from years ago and no resolution have been made to me."
Debt collection,"I've made several attempts to ensure I did not miss my due dates : XXXX/XXXX  payment methods does not allow multiple auto payment schedule dates. ThIs company Website only allows one payment schedule per month. This practice leaves customers/consumers open for miss payment and incurring late fee payment. Thus increasing the debt owed and the balance never ending. 
Calling customer service only credit one late payment fee. I was just recently been able to set up an additional auto payment with my bank 's new-bill pay option.

This was established with my personal banking instituion to set AUTO PAYMENT to avoid late payments & its late fees. Since XXXX and I havent been back to However I was not able to go back to the CREDIT=XXXX/XXXX  TO STOP MY MONTHLY DOUBLE PAYMENT.Since this insititution does not accommodate multiple schedule on their website. Now I'm paying this bill twice. In as much as my debt with this institution will end faster. I am on a tight budget and can not afford to make double payments. 

I've establish the two bank payment due to XXXX/XXXX not allowiing multple payment dates thus causing me to miss scheduling a payment on time.and incurring late fees. i established the second bank bill pay option to avoid late fees in XXXX. In XXXX i received a late fee. 

Please this account is causing me undue stress and can very well be affecting my credit score due to their outdated payment system. as I attempt to make all my outstanding bill monthly payment on time with auto pay until my balance is paid in full."

I called them but never could get an answer as to why they did not credit my payments. Then I was told they had a special dept. to check into payments so I mailed them copies of the checks from the month they claimed were missed. I also emailed copies of the bank statements which noone ever acknowledged either the payments or receipt of the bank statements.Also this company was not sending bills on a regular basis and since I could not speak to anyone there was confusion as to due date. This was long before covid made all companies unreachable and every month no matter what I paid no payment was ever acknowledged nor could I ever get a person to speak to. It was an automated answer which told you to call another no. which was an automated answer for a case worker who altho I left messages and my name and number never answered me in almost two years. I finally called XXXX XXXX firm in XXXX and We tried to reach them by phone with both of us on the line but could not reach a living person only recorded messages. The only way XXXX. XXXX could reach them was by getting in touch with a lawyer who represented them at one time. He said the date due was the XXXX but it had originally had been on the first and there is no way to know when they changed the date. Since them I have still paid every month and I have asked to have the due date changed to the XXXX XXXX of the month. But I have received no acknowledgement of payments made. I sent in two checks for {$600.00} each month for XXXX and XXXX and {$420.00} for XXXX. My payment is {$390.00} a month but there is no credit shown for those payments altho they cashed the checks and I have paid every single month since and including XX/XX/XXXX. Every bill shows XXXX. By refusing to credit my payments this company makes sure I can not refinance my loan and I am stick with their refusal to credit my payments. They also damage the credit I am trying so hard to reestablish since my bankruptcy. This company has not shown good faith in dealing with me and it is over 2 years that they've been refusing to acknowledge my payment.

It also governs creditors, collection agencies and other businesses that furnish information ( furnishers ) to the CRAs. The FCRA provides victims of identity theft with numerous rights. Consumers can bring legal claims against the CRAs and furnishers if they fail to comply with the FCRA.

The most important right is the blocking of information on a credit report that resulted from identity theft. A CRA must block the reporting of any fraudulent information within four business days of receiving a dispute from a consumer that contains : Identification of the fraudulent information ; A copy of an identity theft report ( an identity theft report is an official, valid report filed by the consumer with a federal, state or local law enforcement agency including the post office ) ; A statement by the consumer that the information is not related to any transaction by the consumer ; and Appropriate proof of identity.

The CRA must notify the furnisher of the information that it has blocked the information as fraudulent. The CRA will also notify the two other national CRAs that it has blocked the information. The consumer should receive a letter from the CRA stating that the information has been blocked.

If the consumer sends the CRA the required materials and the CRA does not block the disputed information within four days, the consumer can bring a legal claim against the CRA.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind.

( 1 ) In general.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.

( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter."

Debt collection,"I am filing this complaint regarding an auto loan account reported by Capital One Auto Finance in the amount of approximately {$30000.00}. 

I have disputed this account multiple times over several years and formally requested validation of the debt, including a copy of the original wet-signed contract. Capital One has only provided PDFs, which do not satisfy the legal requirement for validation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

I also completed a full administrative process, sending all notices and demands via certified mail with tracking. Capital One failed to respond lawfully. 

Furthermore, I addressed this alleged debt through the IRS in XXXX, by writing it off in my taxes and submitting a Form XXXX ( payment voucher ) and Form XXXX ( cancellation of withholding obligations ). 

Despite these extensive and documented efforts, Capital One continues to report this invalid and unverified debt to the credit bureaus which is now preventing me from securing housing and pursuing essential needs. 

I am requesting that this account be permanently deleted from all credit reporting agencies and that Capital One be held accountable for continued violations of the FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S. Code 1692g ).

Mortgage,"My mortgage is with PHH Mortgage - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Although, private homeowners insurance has been secured and paid in full, PHH refused to cease collecting on the forced policy for 4 months, is presently holding an overage of XXXX in the escow account for insurance, and purposely delaying adjustment to the loan account to exclude insurance coverage from the monthly payment. 

The issues are 1. We have paid our insurance directly to private insurance for XXXX and made the insurance company aware of the new coverage in XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. The escrowed amount collected during XXXX was returned to PHH from its forced place coverage provider. 
3. Instead of returning the collected overage amount to me ( homeowner ), PHH placed the $ XXXX back into the escrow account and have found creative ways each month to refuse my access to the overage. 
4. Since XXXX, PHH representatives have indicated they would either return the funds by mailed check or apply them to the loan. Neither have occurred. 
5. Also, at our continued demanding, an escrow analysis was finally performed in XX/XX/XXXX to adjust our onging monthly payment amount as we no longer wish to escrow Insurance Coverage ; only taxes. Upon completing the analysis, PHH again refused to return the overage and refused to adjust the ongoing monthly payment amount. 

Therefore, 1. Since XX/XX/XXXX we have paid an inflated montly mortgage in the excess of XXXX XXXXXXXX per month. 
2. There remains XXXX XXXXXXXX sitting in an escrow account that PHH is refusing to either return to us or allocate to the mortage principle. 

In XXXX I was told an escrow analysis would be completed, escrow of insurance would cease and funds would be returned. The attached shows the analysis was completed, however the latter was not. 

Though, I have been struggling with this for 7 months and only today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) did I receive information that an Escrow Removal Form is required to force-stop the insurance escow portion and a new analysis would need to be completed. Every representative gives different information about the PHH internal protocols for resolution and offer only apologies for the lack-of or misinformation relayed by previous representatives. I dont know what will be the new excuse next month."

( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

Mortgage,"In the last 8 years we have tried to get help with OCWEN and now PHH. Always denied, so we filed Bankruptcy but constantly having to refile due to them refusing to help. We paid in through Bankruptcy and brought down outstanding balance to {$290000.00}. But in reduced payments by bankruptcy, we owed XXXX, but they increased the amount due to {$210000.00} making it over XXXX owed. I have tried to talk to them and file to reduce the XXXX interest rate. I have sent them letters to take back fees and payments off so we can get a mortgage. They assessed over XXXX in expenses and payments when PHH took over last year. I begged them to help due to my husband XXXX of XXXX. He died last year in XXXX.

My medical bills were sold to a debt collector without my consent and my privacy was violated under hippa. The company refused to send me a bill or itemized statement telling me what the debt is and where it came from. I was billed on 2 dates XX/XX/XXXX and my debt was sold XX/XX/XXXX. I was also billed XX/XX/XXXX and sold XX/XX/XXXX.
Debt collection,"The original account was with XXXX over 7 years ago. When the account was closed, the remaining balance was credited and was left with a XXXX balance. This account was removed from XXXX, but is still being reported by XXXX and XXXX. This account is more than 7 years old and I am no longer liable for this account as it was paid prior to going to collections with Trident. Each time that there is a new acquisition of XXXX  accounts, this account keeps getting transferred instead of being formerly closed out. I have never had an account with Trident Asset Management and this should be removed from my credit report as it is infringing on my rights to Fair Debt Collection practices. This account appeared on my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX ( never reported prior to this time ) and when I noticed this old debt I contacted the agency to remove. It was agreed that they would remove it, but the debt keeps appearing on my credit report. I contacted the better business bureau and they have sent on XX/XX/XXXX and I also spoke with their representation onXX/XX/XXXX I escalated the call to the manager of the rep as she was unable to produce information as to how my credits were applied ; she advised that this debt was merely validated. I asked for an explanation of charges and this was never produced. This debt is too old to report and should be removed from my credit report instead of keep getting sold to additional credit collection agencies. Please have the company update the records and remove from my credit report."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I understand the process of the investigation is to reach every individual company to verify the accuracy in the information. In accordance to FCRA, Section 611 A through D, you are supposed to let me know who you verified with. In my original investigation request sent back in XXXX and XXXX, I asked the following creditors to delete anything that is not 100 percent accurate. 
This is not the time to update since you had time to update after the first letter. Now that I have pointed out the mistakes, by updating the terms is an admission of guilt and a direct violation of my rights of a fair investigation. You stated it was verified. How is it possible that XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX   all verified the accounts above as accurate, but they all have inconsistencies in the reporting? In fact, there is no possible way a full investigation could have been done in accordance to Section 611 due to the inconsistencies coming after my original request of investigation. XXXX failed to send me any correspondence at all after numerous requests. 
At this point, I demand you delete these accounts immediately, or I have no choice but to seek counsel to point out the rights that have been violated under the FCRA. As you may be aware, "" Estoppel by Silence '' legally means that the credit bureaus and the listed creditors had a duty to speak but failed to do so therefore, that must mean you agree with me that this debt is false. I will use the Estoppel in my defense since I have a track record of you not sending documents back to me.

Debt collection,"In XX/XX/XXXX I moved into my apartment with my daughter. I was approved because of my job that I had been at about 2 years. Shortly after moving in, about a month later, I was let go during Covid. I told my leasing office and the managers, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and they told me they would work with me while I attempted to get work. After a while of not paying -- only finding part-time work -- I was told to apply for rental assistance. I didn't get anywhere with it, as so many others were attempting to get assistance at that time. The managers let me stay for 7 months while I looked for more work. Nearing the XXXX month, after I was only able to come up with some of the money, I was told by the leasing office I would need to either leave on my own accord or an eviction would be filed and I would be forced to go. 
I left to avoid an eviction on my record, but was then told in XXXX of the next year, XXXX, I would have to pay all the previous months of rent that had gone unpaid. I continued to be unable to pay for the next few years so the account went to collections. Now XXXX owns the debt. I tried to reach them once in XXXX to just try to figure out what could be done but was told I would need to remit the full payment, which I could not do, so I let more time pass. Fast forward, I called XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX, now that I have a job and am finally getting back on my feet, almost 5 years later. When I called, I requested access to my client account, but was told by the agent they could not provide me a password to view my debt online because there is/was no password involved. When I visit their website, however, it Does require a default password. Repeatedly the agent told me they could only provide me my account number, but not a password. So I can not view/resolve the debt online. I was also told that they can not provide me any written confirmation once/if the debt was paid, only that I could call to verify it was paid and then call the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX and have them remove the debt from my record. I am a single mom and currently living in a situation I need to get my daughter and I out of. I can not get into any decent apartment because of this debt on my record. I am attempting to pay it, as I have a job now, but I am getting no where. The rep I spoke with at XXXX last told me, yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, that she would try to submit the request to the client ( the apartments ) and see if we could get it paid/settled at a percentage, but has submitted the request a handful of times and is not getting anywhere.

Mortgage,"I am filing this complaint regarding a late mortgage payment reported by Regions Bank for XX/XX/year>. I strongly believe this late payment was incorrectly reported due to a technical issue with Regions online payment system. 

I have been a Regions Bank mortgage customer for nearly XXXX  years and have never missed or been late on a payment prior to this incident. On or around XX/XX/year>, I logged into the Regions Mortgage online system using my phone and submitted my payment as I do every month. However, I did not receive the usual confirmation email.

The moment I was alerted by a credit bureau that the account had been reported late, I immediately made the payment and then paid the following months installment on time as well. At no point was there financial hardship, insufficient funds, or neglect on my part. 
I have contacted Regions Bank multiple times regarding this matter, but they have denied my requests and will not remove the delinquency. I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this issue, as I believe the late payment was reported in error.

A request was made for the original lease agreement, move-out inspection report, photographs at move-out, the ledger of the account, and the Statement of Deposit Account ( SODA ). 

Agency 's Response : Date of response : Tues, XX/XX/2024 Method : Email ( with attached documents ) Summary : The collection agency provided a final account statement but did not include the requested photographs or a signed SODA. The account statement also lacked the necessary managerial signature, and the response fell short of the specific documentation demands outlined in the initial dispute. 

Follow-up Communication : Date of follow-up : Weds, XX/XX/2024 Method : Email Summary : A follow-up email was sent to the collection agency, reiterating the need for complete documentation as per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The requirement for photographic evidence, a signed final account statement, and the SODA was emphasized. A deadline was given, after which further action, including filing complaints with the CFPB and FTC, was to be taken. 

Second Follow-up and Final Ultimatum : Date of second follow-up : Mon, XX/XX/2024 Method : Email Summary : After no response was received to the previous communication, a second follow-up email served as a final ultimatum. The agency was notified that without the requested documentation by the end of the day on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, formal complaints with the CFPB and FTC would be filed. The agency was urged to take immediate action to comply with the requests or face further legal proceedings. 

Current Status : As of Thursday, XX/XX/2024, no adequate response has been received from ProCollect Incorporated. The documentation provided thus far does not meet the standards set by the FDCPA, and the claims made by the agency remain unsubstantiated. The final deadline given to the agency has passed, after which I am prepared to take the necessary steps to escalate the matter in defense of my consumer rights. 

Next Steps : In consequence of the agency 's unwillingness to cooperate or provide adequate documentation, the following actions will be initiated : 1. Filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

2. Filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).

3. Exploring all legal avenues, including consultation with a consumer rights attorney."

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I look at my Credit Report and i see unauthorized inquiries on my report from XX/XX/ 2021. I did not authorize XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, global lending service or XXXX motor acceptance to look at my credit report i dont have any accounts with those companies i have sent letters to experian and the companies asking them to remove the inquiries"
Debt collection,"I received a call from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX saying there was a complaint filed against me from XXXX XXXX and they're going to serve me tomorrow ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at my home or workplace. They gave me a phone number, XXXX, to call with a file number. I called the phone number and asked what their company name was. She just said, "" We represent multiple Law Firms and can't give you details until you tell us if you're calling for yourself or on behalf of someone. '' I told her I was calling for myself and gave her the file number, then she listed off my current address and said mail was sent to me by Wells Fargo back in XXXX. She then listed off my previous address, previous workplace, and SSN. She said that Wells Fargo was suing me for a loan I didn't pay off ( which I never took out ), and stated that my credit is in good standing, listing other credit cards I have. After the call, I called the original number back ( XXXX ) and the same lady answered who had answered the 888 number."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I have disputed with Transunion and XXXX  on several occasions about a creditor I have no affiliation with. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has no legal authority or affiliation with me. I have tried on a number of attempts for them to remove the reporting. They are knowingly hurting my credit standing. They knowingly will not even report any information. I have submitted cancelled checks proving payments. I have provided my court ordered child support documents from the state of Georgia. The Georgia  court orders me to directly pay XXXX, my ex spouse directly. I have complied for over 10 years. 

I respectfully request these credit agencies remove this creditor immediately. It is very sad a Government department can abuse their power and authority and knowingly cause harm to an individual from another state that has absolutely no obligation to work with them. XXXX"
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","This is regarding the failure to properly investigate the tradeline reported by XXXX in accordance with the FCRA. 

Please see ALL attached documents and the facts below. 
FACTS : XXXX states that the account that they are reporting was created in XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX did not have a correct email address or phone number on the account for me but the account was in my name. I never knew the account existed. 

I rented the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX out to tenants in XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. 

My residence address on my driver 's license did not change in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX did not obtain a copy of my drivers license from me. 

The address change on my driver 's license took place 17 months after an account was created with XXXX. This still does not validate the account ever being authorized. 

The facts are XXXX does not have any copies of identifying information to verify that I authorized an account with them and the biggest red flag is the amount of research that they seem to do on the back end but little to no research when creating an account. It does seem that XXXX should utilize their research up front to avoid unauthorized accounts being created."

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2020 I refinanced my home mortgage for a lower rate and term. Soon after my refinance closed the mortgage was sold to AmeriHome Mortgage for servicing the mortgage. My refinance included pre-payment of the escrow. I've also made my required monthly payments, including escrow. My escrow with AmeriHome currently has a balance over $ XXXX. I have an outstanding homeowner 's insurance premium of {$1500.00} that was due as of XX/XX/2020. My insurance documents with AmeriHome are up to date, indicating a payment is past due. So far, I've contacted AmeriHome, including the following occasions : XXXX : Initial call to AmeriHome stating I received notice from my insurance company that the insurance payment wasn't made. They requested I send the insurance email notification to their customer service department, which I did on that day. I was told the payment would then be made. 
XXXX : Follow-up call to confirm if an insurance payment was made, finding no record of a payment was available. I was then requested to send my insurance payment notice to the AmeriHome insurance department email ( XXXX ), which I did on that day. 
XXXX : Follow-up call to confirm if an insurance payment was made, finding no record of a payment was available. AmeriHome confirmed they received my previous email proving an insurance payment was due and would expedite an insurance payment. 
XXXX : Follow-up call to confirm if an insurance payment was made, finding no record of a payment was available. AmeriHome confirmed they received my previous email proving an insurance payment was due and would expedite an insurance payment via work order to be completed by XXXX. 
XXXX : Follow-up call to confirm if an insurance payment was made, finding no record of a payment was available and the work order from XXXX was closed without reason. AmeriHome said they would escalate and issue an insurance payment within 24 - 48 hours.

I will continue to follow up with AmeriHome, but at this point I've received a text, email and letter from my insurance company stating the insurance payment is past due, and my policy will be cancelled as of XX/XX/2020 if full payment is not made. I have been given multiple assurances the insurance payment will be made via my escrow, which has enough funds and continues to be funded via monthly mortgage payments. I have little confidence this will be done and am at risk of losing my legally entitled insurance coverage due to the inability of AmeriHome to meet its requirements of making homeowner 's insurance payments via the escrow account. 

Any assistance would be appreciated."

Upon thorough review, I can confirm that I do not owe any outstanding medical debt. I recently visited my primary care provider, who verified that my account is in good standing with no unpaid balances. 

Furthermore, under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus ( CFPB ) Final Rule issued XX/XX/year>, medical debt is no longer permitted to appear on consumer credit reports used by lenders. This rule, which amends Regulation V under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), prohibits credit reporting agencies from including medical bills and bars lenders from using such information in credit decisions. 

Given this regulatory change, the continued reporting of medical collections on my credit file is both inaccurate and noncompliant with federal law. I respectfully request that this entry be removed immediately and that confirmation of its deletion be provided in writing.

Debt collection,"Here is a list of all the violations that I believe has taken place by Bull City Financial Solutions : 15 United State Code 1692g - I received no information and I sent in a formal complaint to dispute the validity of the debt according the law.

Notice of debt ; contents Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof.

15 U.S. Code 1692e - False or misleading representations - Bull City Financial Solutions false and misleading information stating that the information was being investigated when in fact the information was not being investigated and no information was provided in the connection of this alleged debt.

15 U.S. Code 1692c - Communication in connection with debt collection - Bull City Financial Solutions is communicating with a third party that I did give them permission to communicate with in the connection of this alleged debt by providing this inaccurate information to my consumer report.

15 U.S. Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies.

Duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information ( 1 ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors ( Bull City has been informed that the validity of the debt is in question and the amount owed ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors- ( Bull City was provided a notice that the information is inaccurate and needed to be investigated ).

A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate.

( 3 ) Duty to provide notice of dispute If the completeness or accuracy of any information furnished by any person to any consumer reporting agency is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without notice that such information is disputed by the consumer. ( XXXX  from Bull City Financial Solutions on XX/XX/2024 stated in a phone conversation that the account file was sent to the creditor for investigation and did not notify the consumer reporting agency that the information was being disputed or investigated and refused to have the account removed during this time and did not notify me of any updates or investigation report or any information requested during their unfair and unreasonable investigation. And updated the account stating that Account information disputed by consumer ( Meets requirement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ). 

15 U.S. Code 1681 - Congressional findings and statement of purpose - Based on the amount that XXXX provided she stated the amount she showed was {$150.00} however Bull City Financial Solutions reported that {$160.00} is the amount to my credit report.

The Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance - Bull City Financial Solutions willingly avoided to comply with the provisions under both the fcra and the fdcpa.

15 U.S. Code 1681o - Civil liability for negligent noncompliance- Bull City Financial Solutions was negligent in conducting a reasonable investigation and failed to respond to my request for information to be sent to me via mail so that I can review the information in question. 

I also asked for their license number and was provided with a tax id instead Tax ID that was provided was XXXX instead of their license number. XXXX XXXX on this on this call the account was being disputed and sent over to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2024 my credit report did not indicate that the account was being disputed at any time during this process before and after the call on XX/XX/2024. XX/XX/2024 is the same day they responded to my complaint with the CFPB and closed the complaint by falsely stating that they will contact me and till this day I have not heard anything from Bull City Financial Solutions. The dispute ( XXXX ) was closed with their company with no explanation. I want this account removed from all my consumer reports effective immediately. 

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS UNDER COMPLAINT XXXX AS THE PROOF THAT WAS ALSO SENT PREVIOUSLY IN THIS MATTER. 

I previously requested information on an account that popped up on my credit report. I submitted a request to have the account in question removed while the account was being investigated. Bull City Financial Solutions failed to comply with the request. There were NEVER any communication in the connection of the alleged debt, This is really disheartening to know that Bullcity Financial Solutions can overlook the laws and rules that says that in order to place an alleged debt on a consumer report the debt collector MUST contact the consumer. On this site as well as the FTC site I have found information that clearly states that debt parking is illegal and that a debt collector can not park a debt on a consumer report without first contacting the consumer in the connection of the debt. It is furthermore disheartening that Bull City Financial Solutions responded with none of the information that was requested XXXX and the representative could not assist with the issue because there were no valid information provided in the connection of the investigation. I want to know what reasonable procedures that were taken in investigating and verifying the information on this erroneous debt, I am asking again for all file disclosures and the full sale file and agreement of this debt when it was purchased a full audit trail and I am not talking about billing statements that were purchased I am requesting a full audit report on this account and the rights that Bull City Financial Solutions has over this unknown debt all correspondence with proof of delivery via a tracking number. If none of this information can be produced, I am requesting that this account be completely deleted from all of my consumer reports including the soft inquiry that was placed on my report to place this account on my consumer report. Bull City Financial Solutions had no permissible purpose to pull my report in order to place this account on my consumer report without my permission. This is very frustrating knowing that I have been violated and no one is taking my concerns serious enough to provide me with a reasonable investigation as I am entitled to that right. 

Please conduct a reasonable investigation in this matter thank you. 

I HAVE ATTACHED ALL OF MY CREDIT REPORTS THAT SHOWS THAT THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY WAS NEVER NOTIFIED THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS IN DISPUTE ALSO ATTACHED ARE OTHER PROOF OF INFORMATION."

Debt collection,"Dear Collector, I am writing in response to your letter or phone call dated XXXX. I do not believe that I owe this debt or what you say I owe. Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Section 809 ( b ), Validating Debts : If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. ( emphasis added ) I respectfully request that you provide me with the following : 1. the amount of the debt ; 2. the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; 3. verification or copy of any judgment ( if applicable ) ; 4. proof that you are licensed to collect debts in Maine ; 5. proof of the last payment made on the account. I am asserting my rights under the federal and state Fair Debt Collection Practices Acts and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including these rights : Because I have disputed this debt in writing within 30 days of receipt of your initial notice, you must obtain verification of the debt or a copy of the judgment against me and mail these items to me at your expense. You can not add interest or fees except those allowed by the original contract or state law. Any attempt to collect this debt without validating it violates the FDCPA. Also be advised that I am keeping accurate records of all correspondence from you and your company, including recording all phone calls, and I will not hesitate to report violations of the law to my State Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission and the XXXX XXXX XXXX  I have disputed this debt. Therefore, until it is validated, your information concerning this debt is assumed to be inaccurate. Accordingly, if you have already reported this debt to any credit-reporting agency ( CRA ) or Credit Bureau ( CB ) , then you must immediately inform them of my dispute with this debt. Reporting information that you know to be inaccurate or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act 1681s-2. Should you pursue a judgment without validating this debt, I will inform the judge and request that the case be dismissed based on your failure to comply with the FDCPA.

We were told it would take 3-5 business days to get an answer. We had no response from them after a couple of phone calls. Then I called and spoke to a Supervisor who did not treat me professionally and said that I had this free money and had lived there all these years without paying. My husband and I are XXXX XXXX and had worked very hard to keep our home. They said our balance was $ XXXX ( which started out at {$75000.00} ) and that we would have to come in with {$40000.00} and no other options.

Mortgage,"I have lived in my house for nearly 35 years. I refinanced in XXXX in order to lower my mortgage payment, but later found out that this was a predatory adjustable rate loan. My current interest rate is 9.125 % and I am doing everything I can to resolve my missed mortgage payments but feel that Shellpoint has been obstructing the process and has failed to offer me a full review of my current financial circumstances. My struggles have gone on for several years and during this time I was never once reviewed for HAMP, or offered a forbearance during Covid or considered for HAF programs. I have been sued for foreclosure by Shellpoint but they did not allow me the opportunity to go through the New York mediation program and instead I am trying to fight off foreclosure sale dates while their agents say they cant even look at my paperwork because they did not have all the information six weeks before the foreclosure. I have suffered through loss of employment, health issues, Covid related income loss and litigation from Shellpoint with no consideration for mediation. I have been forced to file bankruptcy to try and figure out a way to resolve this situation but feel like I am getting nowhere -- - because of the predatory adjustable rate loan I am in but also due to Shellpoints indifference. 

I have lived in my home since XXXX and refinanced into a rate and term mortgage to lower my payment in XXXX, not aware that this was an adjustable rate mortgage but my monthly payment has increased by over {$2200.00} a month since I took out this loan because of this adjustable rate feature. I was XXXX XXXX for a nonprofit for 15 years and made a nice living but then I began having major health issues and this coincided with my contract ending for the nonprofit. I had to continue receiving my monthly XXXX even as I lost my health insurance which put me in a bad place financially. I was able to keep up with the payments until XXXX and then I began falling behind. I tried to apply for assistance but never got anywhere with the lender at that time ( XXXX ) and made partial payments as I tried to get through this crisis. I took the initiative and got my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  so that I could try and dig my way out of this mess. However, I ended up filing bankruptcy because it was too hard to catch up with such a high interest rate on the mortgage. I offset my income with XXXX work and kept up with the bankruptcy trustee payments as well as paying the monthly mortgage payment until Covid hit me. My XXXX income was gone and there were no XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at all during that time. Due to this Covid related loss of income I could not keep up with the bankruptcy trustee payments and this was dismissed. I still had to get my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My lender during Covid was XXXX XXXX XXXX and they failed to provide access to the government mandated CARES program to help folks struggling due to Covid related income loss. My situation could have been resolved at that time if my lender would have followed the rules and provided access to this program. I tried to dig out of the financial hole myself and applied for a loan modification again the following year with XXXX but I was denied for lack of income. In order to postpone foreclosure and keep my house I have owned for 35 years I filed bankruptcy again. I was paying monthly mortgage payments of {$3900.00} as well as paying towards the arrearages through the bankruptcy. Then the payment went up again almost {$500.00} in one month because I have this predatory adjustable rate loan. 

During my last bankruptcy the Attorney submitted my paperwork to Shellpoint for a loan modification, but they informed the court that I did not qualify for a loan modification and the bankruptcy was dismissed and they moved to set another foreclosure date on my home."

It is our policy to respond to consumer complaints swiftly and to take each complaint seriously. We appreciate you letting us know about your experiences with Experian. 

AFTER A REVIEW OF EXPERIAN 'S RESPONSE I IMMEDIATELY OBSERVED THAT EXPERIAN HAD AGAIN DOCUMENTED THEIR VIOLATION OF MY CONSUMER RIGHTS AND THE FCRA. Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 1 ) ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) this was not a new dispute or opportunity for you to reinvestigate a previous dispute. The allowable period to conduct such a reinvestigation has expired and shall not be extended by law. I have filed several disputes concerning this issue in the past. Therefore, Experian has had the legally required time to reinvestigate my dispute. They do not get an additional thirty days to conduct another reinvestigation. 

Experian failed to meet its statutory obligations and is knowingly and willfully providing false, inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading information on my consumer report. This has resulted in damage to my reputation, character, and credit worthiness. 

Experian has not conducted a proper reinvestigation of my disputes as mandated by the FCRA because Experian has violated the FCRA Section 607 ( b ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) by failure to use reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy. 

According to the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 611 ( a ) [ 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ], the disputed information must be DELETED from my consumer report within 5 days of receipt of this CFPB compliant."
Debt collection,I FELL VICTIM TO THE EQUIFAX DATA BREACH AND OTHER DATA BREACH WEBSITES AND WOULD LIKE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF THE ACCOUNT FROM MY CREDIT REPORT WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS.
Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX Florida. My wife and I learned while living there of this company 's unusual practice during departure walk-through with the Apartment Manager and staff. 

Their practice was to lift up the carpet, point to a stain, then claim the renter had made the stain. Usually claimed due to pets, no matter whether the tenant had pets or not. 

In anticipation of such behavior, my wife photographed the Apartment Manager and assistant as they conducted the walk-through. They pulled the carpet up in all rooms and wrote on their Departure Walk-through Form that there were no stains or damage from pets or anything else. 

We were provided a copy of the Departure Walk-through Form for our records. We were told our {$300.00} deposit would be sent to our new address. We turned over all keys and gate access codes we had in our possession, thereby effectively no longer having access to the apartment. 

One week later, a different Apartment Manager sent us a demand letter for {$900.00} ( keeping our {$300.00} deposit ) where the carpet replacement company had written an estimate which said "" carpet is XXXX soaked throughout ''. 

I replied by asking who they had allowed into the apartment after we relinquished control? We had photos of them taking photos as they pulled up the carpet in each room as mentioned above. I also reminded the new Apartment Manager we already had a completed Departure Walk-through Form which indicated no damage. 

There was no response for a couple of weeks, then we began to receive demand letters from Post Bay Apartments for {$900.00} to replace the carpet. 

My wife and I then retained a lawyer to ask for some evidence to support their claim. They never responded to the lawyers letter. They subsequently sold the debt to another company, National Credit Systems. 

A representative from National Credit System called me on the phone once, at which time I requested proof, any legal proof, of the debt. They declined, and entered a derogatory entry on my credit. Following that initial call they would not return phone calls nor would they respond to letters sent through the mail. 

The cost of hiring a lawyer to correct the issue was more than {$1500.00}. My wife and I decided we would wait until we were denied a mortgage or similar loan request, due to this fake debt. Nothing happened despite two mortgages closing. 

So, this past XXXX I wrote to all three credit agencies informing them the debt was unsubstantiated. I received responses from all three that m dispute had been recorded, but they were not going to remove the fake debt. 

My wife and I are once again applying for a VA backed mortgage. The Loan Officer contacted me on the phone and she informed me how the dispute must be removed before and loan initiation process could start. 

I was unaware of the CFPB. She said that one of the purposes of the CFPB was to address issues just like mine. 

We have documentation and pictures as well as letters written on our behalf by a lawyer in XXXX. 

We do not have is any proof that supports the debt. Nor do they. Only their assertions. It is now obvious to me that if I do n't pay them their ransom money, I cant buy our new house. Its like credit report blackmail. 

I was told by the loan officer for my new house that the CFPB was created for just such situations as I have found myself in."

Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX XX/XX/year> Goodleap XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, OR XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Complaint Submission ( via www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint ) Subject : Formal Dispute of Alleged Debt, Violations of 12 CFR 1006.34, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, and North Carolina Statute of Limitations To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute the alleged debt being collected by Goodleap LLC and to report multiple violations of federal and state consumer protection laws. This letter serves as both a formal dispute to Goodleap LLC and as supporting documentation for a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

1. Violation of 12 CFR 1006.34 ( Validation Notice Requirements )
Goodleap LLC has failed to provide the required validation information under 12 CFR 1006.34 ( a ) ( 1 ), which mandates that debt collectors supply consumers with : The debt amount, The name of the original creditor, A statement of the consumers right to dispute the debt, and A copy of the debt verification. 

Goodleap LLCs failure to comply with these requirements invalidates their claim and obligates them to cease all collection activities until validation is provided.

2. Violation of 12 CFR 1006.34 ( d ) ( Failure to Honor Dispute Rights ) I previously disputed this debt in writing, yet Goodleap LLC continues to report it to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ) without providing verification. Under 12 CFR 1006.34 ( d ) ( 2 ), they are required to halt collection activities, including credit reporting, until the debt is validated. Their ongoing reporting constitutes unlawful harassment. 

3. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( A ) ( FCRA Furnisher Obligations ) By furnishing incomplete or inaccurate information to CRAs without providing mandatory disclosures, Goodleap LLC has violated 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( A ). This statute requires furnishers to report only accurate, complete, and verifiable data. Their actions have harmed my creditworthiness, entitling me to damages under the FCRA. 

4. Use of Deceptive and Misleading Practices Goodleap LLC has engaged in false, misleading, and deceptive collection tactics, including : Threatening credit reporting without legal justification, Misrepresenting the debts validity, Failing to disclose their lack of authority to collect.

These actions violate 15 U.S.C. 1692e of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

5. North Carolina Statute of Limitations on Debt Under N.C. Gen. Stat. 1-52 ( 1 ), the statute of limitations for debt collection in North Carolina is three years from the date of default or the date of last activity on the account. This means that after three years, a creditor or debt collector can not sue to collect the debt. If the alleged debt is older than three years, Goodleap LLC is legally barred from pursuing legal action to collect it.

6. Additional Requests and Demands Debt Validation : I request full validation of the alleged debt, including : The original creditors name and contact information, A copy of the purchase agreement proving Goodleap LLCs right to collect, Proof of licensing and bonding in North Carolina. 

Removal from Credit Reports : I demand that Goodleap LLC remove the collection account from all consumer reporting agencies within 15 days.

Revocation of Communication Consent : I hereby revoke any consent to contact me via email, text, or telephone. All future communications must be in writing via U.S. Mail. 

Cease All Collection Activities : Until all requested documentation and validation is provided, I demand that Goodleap LLC cease all collection activities.

Summary of Legal Violations and Demands Goodleap LLC has violated 12 CFR 1006.34, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( A ), and 15 U.S.C. 1692e.

The statute of limitations for debt collection in North Carolina is three years ( N.C. Gen. Stat. 1-52 ( 1 ) ).

I demand removal of the collection account from all credit reports, full validation of the debt, and proof of licensing and bonding.

I revoke consent for all electronic communications and demand that all future correspondence be in writing. 
To the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : I am submitting this letter as part of my formal complaint against Goodleap LLC. I request that the CFPB investigate these violations and take appropriate action to protect my consumer rights. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX."

I never received any notice of a final bill or any indication that a payment had failed.

Unfortunately, I have no documentation of those store visits.

I never received any legally required debt validation letter. AmSher later claimed a letter was sent on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX but I truly never received it. I am currently requesting proof of mailing. 

I also contacted XXXX recently. They confirmed they can not access my records without verifying my PIN, and that I will need to visit a store to retrieve my billing history. I am willing to do that. 

Until now, I have never received a clear itemized breakdown or proper explanation from either XXXX or the collection agency. I am willing to pay the {$99.00} if properly validated, but I strongly dispute the extra charges and the handling of this process."
Debt collection,"I am writing to dispute a billing issue related to my credit card account.

Toward the end of the month, the issuer increased my credit limit to {$500.00}. However, I was then informed that my payment due was $ XXXX having only spent {$120.00}. 

In response, I stopped using the card and paid the {$120.00} that I rightfully owed. Despite this, my account now reflects an additional balance of {$60.00}, which I do not understand and am unable to pay due to my fixed monthly budget. I believe this situation is unfair and request that it be reviewed and resolved accordingly."

Every time I make this request, t I am sent a short list they printed out showing the chain of debt ownership from the original creditor down to LVNV. 

However, all it is is a short printed list. There is no actual proof that the list is valid or that they own this debt and are entitled to correct it. I've sent cease and desist letters requesting they remove the debt collections from my credit report and they refuse to provide proper proof of ownership or have the collections removed from all of my credit reports. 

Instead, they just have a different company reach out to request funds to pay the debt. I've had at least three to five separate companies try to collect this debt from me.

I have also attached a copy of my Alabama XXXX billing statement to show a complete summary of how much my monthly charges have been up through XXXX when Ditech called them and took over billing for the power on the property.

Ditech has NEVER paid for the Water/garbage on the property and I recently had the water turned off to the property and closed that account when Ditech informed me that they had the property winterized.

I have been given no other alternatives and I have been told by XXXX ( the loan company for my second mortgage ) that the representative from Ditech has only called them 1X to discuss any type of settlement. Again, the communication with the mitigation representative ( XXXX ) at Ditech is unacceptable. I only received call backs the first week after my first complaint to CFPB. I need this resolved.

When I asked the agent which account was used she was unable to provide this information. She then proceeded to tell me that the department had tried to contact my husband or myself. I asked her did they try to call? No? A letter was mailed * probably the same day that the paper check was mailed * * I asked why would the escrow department not deposit a funding amount in the account the borrower had been making their mortgage payments in over the last year? This is something that needs to be addressed. Also If a company states they reached out with no answer are there phone records? Having a letter sent is not "" reaching out ''. Now because of XXXX XXXX 's incompetence with my escrow account we are having to wait the "" XXXX business days '' for a paper check. A recommendation I would suggest to their business line is if a payment comes back as not a valid account maybe REACH OUT TO THE CUSTOMER AND ASK IF THE ACCOUNT IN QUESTION IS STILL VALID? NO? IS THERE AN ACCOUNT PREFERED? CUSTOMER CAN PROVID UPDATED ACCOUNT AND FUNDS CAN BE RELEASED. Not having this option is poor customer service, poor client services and poor mortgage closure handling."

On XX/XX/XXXX, the appellate court ruled in my favor stating Discover Bank was not in standing to sue.

Wherefore, the judgment against me was reversed and vacated by the appellate court on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The appellate court stated that Discover Bank was in violation of A.R.S. 6-201, 6-217, 6-322 ( A ) because it is not licensed through the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions ( or as a National Banking Association ) to legally engaged in the business of banking in the state of Arizona, which included, but not limited to, opening an account for, extending credit to, me as well as trying to collect on an alleged debt.

Illegal control of an enterprise and/or illegally conduction an enterprise pursuant to A.R.S. 13-2312.

Mortgage,"During the Covid pandemic, me and my family were adversely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Our mortgage company offered me an forbearance plan and reassured me that I would be able to modify my loan after the pandemic forbearance. I accepted the plan. I then abruptly received a letter demanding full payment or my house would be foreclosed. I was baffled because I was made to understand that I would be able to participate in a government program that would assist me with bringing my past payments current. I did not qualify and was denied mortgage assistance and a modification. 
I was able to get a high interest rate loan and was able to pay the past due amount. My first mortgage became current then months later I received a letter from SLS stating that they are going to foreclose on my home from a second mortgage that our mortgage investor purchased. This second loan was a predatory loan and from my understanding, was charged off in the XXXX housing crisis. I was informed to not pay the second and only pay the first due to my financial hardship. I hadnt heard from the second mortgage company for years, as it no longer exists. 
In or around XXXX, I filed for XXXX XXXX and the second loan, purchased by SLS was stripped down to {$50000.00}. After approximately four years of payments, I could no longer afford my XXXX XXXX  payments and fell out of my XXXX. I attempted to reconcile the {$50000.00} debt to no avail. I hadnt heard from the second mortgage until XXXX, towards the cooling down of the Covid pandemic. SLS demanded {$230000.00} payment. We asked for a modification and SLS wouldnt approve. We didnt hear back from the mortgage again and thats when we received the foreclosure notice in or around XXXX of XXXX. 
Apparently, our home gained equity and the second mortgage is considered a zombie loan that matured. They are going after my homes equity, known as an equity stripping practice. 
Due to Covid, my grown children, including my grandchildren, had to return home. I almost died due to contracting covid and it has taken a major toll on my and my families health and well-being. We have no other place to go and will be homeless as our credit and current finances wouldnt allow us to qualify for even an apartment. We were due diligent, paying our mortgage and remaining current to now have to face foreclosure again. I have endured discriminatory practices since I purchased my home in XXXX. I received nothing but predatory, high interest, sub-prime loans, even with making a substantial amount of money and having reasonably good credit. Its systematic racism/discrimination that I didnt want to believe but its blatantly obvious that I was put into this predicament to fail to gentrification. Me and my family have worked very hard and have never used government resources and when we needed them, we didnt qualify and were denied. We are between a rock and a hard place and our blood, tears and sweat prevent me from giving up as we will fight for our home. Please help us with this situation.

Around XX/XX/2018 they started contacting me from their toll free number and they have left voicemails twice. I never gave them permission to ever leave voicemails on my phone from either number. The heading on their collection letters states they are not legally allowed to call or leave voicemails to anyone without permission.
Debt collection,"I was contacted by credit collections on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX stating I owed {$230.00}. I never received a bill, so disputes charge with credit collections. They stated they were waiting on a response from XXXX and would validate charges. I never received a bill. XXXX XXXX also told me that this would not be placed XXXX my credit report until dispute was validated."

I had to call and speak to XXXX customer service people and email to open tickets and I finally had the XXXX go towards my principal.

The letter did not include any supporting documentation such as a signed agreement, account statements, or proof of ownership of the debt.

I submitted an assistance application in XXXX, which was approved by SLS. I was told I would have the necessary time of 90 days to obtain a ratified purchase order. I was also instructed to continue to apply to make sure my status of short sale approval with SLS continued to be active. I did just that submitting two additional applications in XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX. SLS states they received my application in XXXX ; however, they ignored the application and stated they did not receive the XX/XX/XXXX application. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, SLS wrongfully closed my short sale application and immediately placed a sale date on my file. I followed the instructions and directions of the SLS representative and now I am being penalized and being forced into a foreclosure sale. 
My understanding is that my file would continue to stay open for 90 days as I attempted to get a contract on my home. I sent a new application for a short sale on XXXX which was ignored and an additional application on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure the application stayed open. On XXXX I was able to ratify a purchase contract to have my home purchased. This information was sent to SLS with the required information needed to complete short sale approval and this was denied!

Keep in mind, that BOA only left me with XXXX in my checking for my family to feed and at that time it was snowing and cold, I had to borrow money to pay my electricity bill to stay warm.

Neither of the 2 collection firms and of the 3 credit reporting bureau 's have provided me the method of validation and/or contracts that bear my signature on these so-called alleged debts.

They just keep sending me bill statements that are not a method of Validation.

And after looking into the alleged debt they failed to provide me verification/validation.

I was advised to speak with a representative from my states Attorney Generals office regard Statute of Limitation. I have sent letters to both the 2 firms and 3 credit bureaus regarding the Statute of Limitation in my State of Florida.

In Florida, the statute lasts five years for a written contract and four years for a credit card account.

95.11 : Actions other than for recovery of real property shall be commenced as follows : ( 2 ) Within five years.

( b ) A legal or equitable action on a contract, obligation, or liability founded on a written instrument ( 3 ) Within four years.

( k ) A legal or equitable action on a contract, obligation, or liability not founded on a written instrument, including an action for the sale and delivery of goods, wares, and merchandise, and on store accounts.

Florida Debt Collection Statutes of Limitation Almost all other actions fall under the 4-year catch-all limitations period, ( F.S. 95.11 ( 3 ) ( p ) ).

Regardless, if a debt collector or a debt buyer that has taken over the debt files a lawsuit on a debt where the statute of limitations has expired, not only can you dismiss the case, but you may have rights to pursue that collector or buyer under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

The FDCPA prohibits collectors from taking action to collect a debt that they can not legally take. In many states, filing a lawsuit beyond the statute of limitations is a fundamental illegality. If they have taken this step, you have rights to pursue under the FDCPA.

Mortgage,"I am filing this complaint to report M & T Banks repeated violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), 12 U.S.C. 2605, in connection with the mismanagement of my escrow account. 

Despite multiple Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ), M & T has failed to provide a substantive response and continues to conceal material information regarding my escrow account. Their most recent response contained raw numbers without documentation or explanation, and ignored the core issues raised. 

Specific Failures by M & T Bank Escrow Transparency They have not disclosed the names, addresses, and amounts of payees for tax and insurance disbursements. Without this, I can not verify that funds were properly applied.

Escrow Analysis No corrected escrow analysis was provided. Instead, they presented unexplained increases in monthly obligations with no methodology or reconciliation. 

Escrow Advances & Adjustments No documentation was produced regarding escrow advances, forced charges, or adjustments that have been assessed against me. 

Suspense/ Misapplied Payments They failed to disclose whether funds were placed into suspense accounts or misapplied. 

By withholding this information, M & T has engaged in a pattern of bad-faith servicing conduct and has directly caused financial harm. 

Harm and Damages As a result of M & Ts escrow mismanagement and stonewalling : I was forced to take out loans to cover unexpected escrow shortfalls. 

I had to withdraw money from my retirement, jeopardizing my long-term financial security. 

I have endured ongoing emotional distress and hardship, knowing my home remains at risk because the servicer refuses to provide transparency. 

The stress and uncertainty caused by their misconduct has directly impacted my familys financial stability and well-being. 

Remedy Requested I request that the CFPB require M & T Bank to : Produce a complete escrow accounting since the inception of servicing, including all deposits, disbursements, and payee information.

Provide a corrected escrow analysis that reconciles the unexplained increases and inflated balances. 

Document all escrow advances, forced-placed charges, and adjustments applied to my account. 

Disclose and correct any misapplication of payments or suspense account activity. 

Provide financial restitution for the hardship I suffered, including loans I was forced to take, retirement withdrawals, and emotional distress caused by their misconduct. 

M & T Banks behavior demonstrates a willful disregard for RESPA obligations and constitutes unfair and deceptive servicing practices. They are attempting to mask serious escrow mismanagement behind superficial numbers while ignoring lawful requests for transparency. 

I respectfully request immediate investigation, enforcement, and consumer relief."

Mortgage,"I am attempting to pay off my mortgage with Mr. Cooper ( Nationstar Mortgage ). On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a {$2400.00} payment through their online portal, explicitly selecting for it to be applied to pay down the principal. This was not intended to be a full payoff. I fully expected a remaining balance, which I planned to pay as soon as the {$2400.00} was applied. 

Instead, the {$2400.00} was placed into unapplied funds, and my loan balance was not reduced. This payment was not ambiguous - I selected the "" apply to principal '' option at the time of the transaction. My account dashboard now shows a negative payment due of $ ( XXXX ), confirming that the funds were received and that I have overpaid - yet the mortgage is still active and the payment has not been credited. 

The estimated payoff for that same date was {$2600.00}, meaning I was within approximately {$230.00} of closing the loan entirely. I contacted Mr. Cooper through their secure message system, citing CFPB servicing rules that require timely application of clearly identified payments. Instead of resolving the issue, they responded by stating it was sent to their "" Research Team '' for review and that I should wait up to 7 business days. 

This appears to be a deliberate delay tactic to block a timely loan payoff, delay escrow refund processing, and possibly capture additional interest or a forced monthly payment."
Debt collection,"In XXXX, I had an ER visit. I paid the imaging and hospital bills in full. Unknown to me, the facility uses a third-party provider for their doctors ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX of AZ ). 

I NEVER received any bills from XXXX XXXX of this year, nearly XXXX years laterwhen I suddenly got a call and letter from a debt collector ( Credit Management Company ) saying I owed {$890.00}. It also hit my credit score, dropping it by XXXX points ( which Ive disputed ). 

I first called the hospital and learned about the third-party billing ( XXXX ) ( I initially thought it was a mistake at first ). My insurance confirmed no claim was ever submitted by this company. When I called XXXX they admitted they never billed me or my insurance, and they sent it straight to collections ( but didnt explain why which Im assuming is because they made a mistake ). 

My insurance contacted them directly and told them to write it off and rescind the account from collections since it wasnt my fault the claim was never submitted and that I never received a bill. Ive followed up four times since XXXX of XXXX, and they keep saying were working on it, give us XXXX business days, but nothing changes and Im sick of calling them at this point. They are not communicating with the collections agency they sold my debt to. 

In XXXX, XXXX finally sent me a statement ( I can provide proof of this statement ) showing most of the bill was paid ( insurance agreed to pay it despite the late claim submission ), with only {$36.00} of the bill remaining ( which I paid ). Again, XXXX still hasnt communicated this with the Credit Management Company so they still think I owe. 

I sent the statement from XXXX XXXX weeks ago showing my insurance processed the claim as well as the EOB from my insurance company to Credit Management Company via certified mail and have not heard back from them. They still continue to call me, but I am not answering their calls anymore. 

What should I do?

I advise LexisNexis of this in the last investigation that the case number XXXX isnt the correct sequence to pull my case in public record, yet they refuse to due the proper due diligence correctly.

Based on the law it says that the bureau should have completed their investigation or responded to me within 30 days and notify me of the results.

Prior to submitting this complaint I also wrote a letter demanding them to respond because it is has been 30 days and I should have received some type of response by now.

Debt collection,"Original Complaint ID : XXXX This is a follow-up complaint regarding the above-referenced CFPB case. I am responding to the written submission made by Niederman, Stanzel & Lindsey, PLLC, who responded on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX. Niederman requested a certified default judgment against me based on an allegedly owed amount that is inconsistent with other documents. They also omitted disclosing that the certified judgment and related court documents were served to me by mail, which contradicts their claims of proper personal service. This omission and misstatement constitute an attempt to collect an incorrect amount through deceptive and misleading practices. 

New Issues Raised by Their Response : XXXX. Contradiction in Method of Service In their court filings, Niederman specifically requested that the complaint be personally served certified. However, in their CFPB response, they now claim the complaint was simply mailed by the court. This contradicts their sworn representation to the court. I was never personally served with the complaint, only with the Order of Notice, and the court clerk confirmed that no complaint or summons was sent to me. This undermines the validity of the judgment they are enforcing.

2. Debt Balance Discrepancy Their response to the CFPB lists the account balance as {$1500.00}, but in their court filings, they requested periodic payments for {$1600.00}. There is no explanation or breakdown for this {$110.00} discrepancy. I have not received any itemization or contractual basis for the inflated amount. 

3. No Match to My Credit Report The account number referenced in their documents does not match any tradeline on my credit report. No signed agreement or complete chain of title has been provided. I dispute that the debt they are attempting to enforce even belongs to me. 

4. Contradiction of XXXX  Previous "" Cease and Desist '' Statement In a prior CFPB response, XXXX stated the account was marked Cease and Desist and the tradeline would be deleted. Despite this, Niederman is now actively enforcing a court judgment and pursuing periodic payments on that same account. This is a direct contradiction and potentially violates their representations to federal regulators. 

XXXX. Ongoing AG Complaint Not Disclosed Niederman failed to disclose in their CFPB response that they are currently the subject of an open consumer protection complaint with the New Hampshire Attorney General, which they received on XX/XX/2025. They are required to respond to that letter, but instead are pursuing legal enforcement and made no mention of this ongoing regulatory action in their CFPB reply."

In an effort to resolve this billing discrepancy, a representative from XXXX contacted your central office. Unfortunately, the matter was not resolved, and the call was redirected to the local XXXX XXXX office, where we were put on hold for 30 minutes before being disconnected without establishing contact with your billing office.

I have attached two invoices for {$190.00} and {$700.00}, respectively. The first invoice of {$190.00} is for a new patient service advertised as free at your local office. However, you continue to bill me for this service, inspite of your office representative written note on the statement hat it it to write off. 

Furthermore, your most recent invoice has increased to {$700.00}, citing the insurance company 's denial of the discount claim you submitted.

XXXX Representative, XXXX contacted your XXXX XXXX office to verify where you obtained this discounted information, however, they did not respond to the phone call. 

The patient responsibility amount provided on the form is {$340.00}, which was paid in full to your office prior to the service. Your consultation form correctly states {$0.00} coverage for "" insurance benefits, so why submit a claim to them? Additionally, the main question is regarding the {$500.00} insurance discount your office applied.

It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end.

I respectfully request to be provided proof of this alleged item, specifically the contract, note or other instrument bearing my signature Failing that, the item must be deleted from the report as soon as possible. The listed item is entirely inaccurate and incomplete, and as such represents a very serious error in your reporting.

When I asked him to send me a copy of that he refused stating that it was private information. 
After checking more into the matter : I purchased the car from DT on XX/XX/XXXX on a contract that was not signed by me. A DT employee forged my name on the contract. 
DT started that I was behind in my payments the month of XX/XX/XXXX thru the month of XX/XX/XXXX. DT has always had the SS # as XXXX and refused to talk with me several occasions because I did not have the right number. 
Per my credit report : On XX/XX/XXXX, my SS # was reported on my report.

Debt collection,"I was initially contacted by representatives from Williams & Fudge in early 2019 who attempted to collect a debt that I did not owe. Despite not providing appropriate and authentic debt verification when requested as well as ignoring numerous documentation and attachments I provided that indicated the debt they were attempting to collect was not mine, they persistently harassed me and continuously contacted me trying to collect it with no evidence. After repeatedly telling there representatives to stop contacting me since there was no active proof that this debt was authentically mine, I was pushed to the point of seeking legal action for the continuous harassment. Once I had mentioned the legal threats, they finally seemed to understand that this debt isn't mine and stopped contacting me about it. For whatever reason, they recently seemed to try to send an email which appeared as spam in which they said that if they don't hear from me, they will assume the debt is mine. This is absurd and obviously a malicious tactic as I already indicated dozens of times previously that the debt they are attempting to collect is not mine."

Debt collection,"Pinnacle Recovery , Inc. is reporting a collection tradeline on my credit reports that is inaccurate, unvalidated, and in violation of federal law.

Pinnacle is not the original creditor and has not provided evidence that it owns this alleged debt or has the legal right to report it.

Pinnacle reports an account opened date of XX/XX/XXXX, joint account responsibility, and a balance of {$1000.00}. This is misleading and misrepresents the legal status of the alleged debt.

Pinnacle has never sent me the required written notice under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) within 5 days of its first communication, which includes its act of furnishing data to the credit bureaus.

Reporting without providing the initial notice deprived me of my statutory right to dispute and request validation directly.

Violations : FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692e & 1692g : false representation of ownership, failure to provide required notice, and failure to validate.

FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) : furnishing inaccurate and incomplete information to credit bureaus.

Strict Validation & Chain of Custody Requested : I demand that Pinnacle provide a full chain of custody proving its legal right to report and collect on this alleged debt, including : All bills of sale, assignments, or forward flow agreements showing every transfer of ownership from the original creditor to the current entity.

Any contract of assignment or servicing agreement authorizing Pinnacle to act as an agent if it does not own the debt notarized docs.

The original signed agreement with the alleged creditor.

A complete itemization and accounting of the balance, including interest, fees, and payments applied.

No such documents have ever been provided to me.

Legal Authority : Brady v. Credit Recovery Co., 160 F.3d 64 ( 1st Cir. 1998 ) misrepresentation of authority violates the FDCPA.

Wadlington v. Credit Acceptance Corp., 76 F.3d 103 ( 6th Cir. 1996 ) only an assignee of the debt can claim creditor rights.

Macik v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 2005 WL 1529581 ( S.D. Tex. 2005 ) inaccurate reporting of creditor identity violates the FCRA.

FTC Staff Opinion Letter ( LeFevre, 1999 ) : a debt collector may not report as a creditor unless it owns the debt.

Requested Resolution : Require Pinnacle to provide the full chain of custody documentation listed above ; If Pinnacle can not validate ownership and rights, require immediate deletion of this tradeline from all credit bureaus ; Ensure Pinnacle ceases reporting and collection activity until it complies with both the FDCPA and FCRA. If not in compliance I promise you I will take legal action."

Mortgage,"Good afternoon, I am reaching out today inquiring about a traumatic experience that happened to me some years ago and is past the statue of limitations period. I reached out to the fraud division years ago also reaching out to our Attorney General 's Office. Multiple times. 

I was the victim of an elaborate housing market scam in late XXXX during the housing market collapse. I was presented an opportunity with a person whos portfolio seemed solid and since I was very young I trusted them. At the time I was working for the state of Delaware as a pay grade XXXX or XXXX barely making XXXX, working with this person who informed me that flipping homes is a great investment and they would help me with whatever I needed. 

At the time I did not have much credit, but it also wasnt poor credit either, this person was able to scam and forge documentation to the point I was given a XXXX loan to flip a property at the following link. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX The person attended the closing with me, the lawyer kept asking me if I was SURE this is what I wanted, but I trusted them and said yes. After closing was complete, I never saw or heard from this person again for years. I also found out that the person who helped me was working with the seller of the home. Home was never finished, and when going to the county for answers I found that the property did not have water pipes, and was not even a residential property at all. I have found out that others have also been scammed and records show the father of the person who scammed me was the seller.

Also documents will show a misuse of my middle and hyphenated last name which proves that documents were forged."

Now over a year after, I received a letter from a second debt collector and disputed it as well. Now the debt collector sided with XXXX because I no longer can find my receipt from XXXX."

I did not open this account, yet I am now being harassed from multiple directions with threats of legal action for something I have absolutely no connection to. This situation is not just unfair, it is a violation of my consumer rights. As someone who has always acted responsibly, I find it incredibly insulting to be treated as if Ive done something wrong. The constant calls, messages, and pressure have affected my mental health and caused countless sleepless nights."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other",XXXX used predatory lending practices and was in litigation with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . These predatory practices have affected me as a consumer because they have put a charge off on my credit for over {$20000.00} that has been there for XXXXyrs and XXXX months that should not be there!
Mortgage,"I am submitting this now because I noticed a number of newspaper articles outlining problems stemming from unethical and intentionally misleading practices at Wells Fargo. I thought it was just me and it was impossible to get vindication so I didn't speak out. I've never been treated so poorly by any group or business in my life. I started typing up my call notes because I was so shocked by the behavior I encountered.

I haven't seen many articles yet addressing the experience I had and I want to make sure that this portion of the company 's mishandling of mortgage loans is not overlooked. Wells Fargo LOST our file after 7 months of working through a mortgage modification which, in turn, caused us to have to start over ( after seven months ) and also caused a sheriff 's sale notice, foreclosure proceeding, and excessive extra fees. They acknowledged that the person handling our file had left and the file was lost and told me I had to start over with a new type of modification because the old one was no longer available. At the same time they started foreclosure proceedings and, at various times, called me a liar and refused to acknowledge that I had been following all steps prior to my file being lost.

During this same time my grandmother moved in for her end-of-life care and I was completely traumatized worrying they would foreclose and we would have nowhere to go for her final weeks of life. I was so deflated, humiliated and exhausted after I finally was able to resolve the situation ( after a year ) that I didn't have the strength to file complaints and then, as time passed, I just tried to forget but I've been able to let go of the anger and hurt that they caused. 

Please note that I recorded all communication, I never missed a requirement that they asked for and I reached out almost weekly throughout the entire process. I filed a complaint after I was able to get a modification. I sent this to their written complaint department and never received a reply. I have copies of that complain letter that outlines everything and copies of all letters Wells Fargo sent that show they knew we were in a modification process and still moved to foreclosure. I have detailed records of the entire experience which ruined my credibility in the small community where I lived at the time, caused me to lose momentum in my professional advancement and ruined my credit score for years which cost me higher interest on future loans for years. In addition, Wells Fargo assessed a lot of fees thereby increasing the amount I had to pay them to settle and get the modification. 

This incident started in XX/XX/XXXX during the recession. I lost my job and found a job at a third of my prior pay. I had fallen behind on my mortgage and had reworked my bills so I could afford to make payment moving forward but was struggling to come up with the extra for the amount I was behind. I reached out to Wells Fargo to see if they could offer any assistance. That was in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX they notified me that they did have options available. On XX/XX/XXXX they said they would send me information on the HomeSaver Advance program. I filled out an initial hardship letter and faxed it in the same day. In XX/XX/XXXX I received instructions to make reduced payments for three months while they worked on the modification. I continued to receive past due and threatening notices even though I was doing everything exactly as instructed. I continued to call all during those months. On XX/XX/XXXX I was told that the paperwork was coming in the mail for me to sign to finalize the new agreement. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I sent another batch of updated financial information. By XX/XX/XXXX I started receiving letters stating that I had to send in the full amount past due or they would proceed with foreclosure action. I was panicked and calling every week. On the phone they would tell me that a date for Sheriff 's Sale would not be set while my file was in review. However on XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice that a date was set for sheriff 's sale. 

I started filing written complaints and calling almost every other day. I often sat on hold for 50+ minutes and was transferred multiple times with each call. It wasn't until later in XX/XX/XXXX that I received a letter from Wells Fargo ( with conflicting dates bouncing back and forth between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) that offered the HAMP. This was a full 9 months after I first reached out to Wells Fargo. A full 9 months of my following all of their requirements and submitting everything required, paying down debt, working extra jobs to increase my income so I could honor my promises. 

Again, I had to start the three-month trial period payment plan ( first done back in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX before my file was lost ) and this time it would put me past the sheriff 's sale date and they would not guarantee that the foreclosure wouldn't happen while I was in the trial period. My Grandmother moved in for her end-of-life care the end of XX/XX/XXXX and I spent the final two months of her life caring for her and worrying myself sick every day not knowing if they would show up to take our home. 

I was finally able to get a HAMP in XX/XX/XXXX days after my grandma died and over a year from when I started the process.

I am writing to alert the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of a collections company that is violating my rights and not using proper communication methods when showing up on my credit report. I need the CFPB office to please look into my case. This account has just popped up on my credit report without ever communicating to me. There was no written letter to me or calls to me so I can explain that they have the wrong person.

I do not owe this company and I Right now I am getting an alert on my credit karma and credit monitoring service saying my XXXX XXXX has dropped tremendously. I can furnish the images of this alert showing the collections company. They are hurting me financially and this is a really big issue. To my understanding they must be compliant with laws and regulations that say they must write the consumer within days of the first communication. They are using my credit to communicate with me yet they NEVER wrote me before.. If they don't write me then how could send me a right to dispute or explain my rights? Please review the original paperwork for this account. I request they send me a copy of this information to my address. I also request the original contract signed showing my signature long with all other pages of the original agreement. I am suffering damages because of this error. I have been a victim of ID theft before and I monitor my financial affairs very closely. To me this seems like an instance of debt parking that I read about on the FTC website. The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against debt collection companies that allegedly placed bogus or highly questionable debts onto consumers credit reports to coerce them to pay the debts. They label this as DEBT PARKING. The Federal Trade Commission recently took action against a Missouri XXXX XXXX and its owners, alleging that they collected more than {$24.00} XXXX from consumers, largely by placing bogus or highly questionable debts on their credit reports. The defendants used this illegal debt parking to coerce people to pay debts they didnt owe or didnt recognize, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in prepared remarks about the agencys settlement with the company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I DO NOT HAVE ANY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS COMPANY and I am concerned they have unethically acquired my information and they are acting unethically with their debt collections.

Debt collection,I have two collections that popped up on my credit. I requested account information and was never given any. They started calling and harassing me. Then they took me to court.

Debt collection,"I am filing this complaint because XXXX is attempting to collect on multiple Affirm accounts that were impacted by a documented fraud incident in late XXXX and early XXXX. 

During that period, my linked bank account was repeatedly overdrawn due to fraudulent withdrawals unrelated to Affirm. I notified Affirm of the fraud and the account issues at the time and asked for help preserving my credit standing. Despite my communication, Affirm continued to auto-debit small loan payments ( about 20+ per month across multiple loans ) from an account that was already overdrawn, triggering a cascade of returned payments. 

This was not a case of me abandoning the debt it was a mishandled fraud-related hardship. Affirm should have paused collections and worked out a resolution, but instead they allowed the accounts to default and then transferred all balances to XXXX a few months ago for collection. 

XXXX is now pursuing me for these balances without acknowledging the underlying fraud, the mishandling by Affirm, or the fact that my credit has been severely damaged because of it. This harm is ongoing, as XXXX continues to report and attempt to collect on these accounts despite the dispute and the documented fraud, further damaging my credit and financial stability."

Mortgage,"In early XXXX of XXXX, I received notification from Fay Servicing , LLC informing me that they will hereby service my loan from settlement on XX/XX/XXXX, from a previous lender. 

As per the settlement HUD, a total of {$1600.00} was deposited with the lender as follows : County taxes ( {$890.00} ) Hazard Insurance ( {$740.00} ) On XX/XX/XXXX, Fay Servicing , LLC applied the full amount of {$1600.00} into the Escrow account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an Escrow Analysis from Fay Servicing , LLC claiming a shortage of {$1900.00} in the Escrow account. Despite the {$890.00} tax amount already deducted at settlement, Fay Servicing paid an additional Township tax of {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for tax year XXXX. The alleged tax payment amount of {$2500.00} is inaccurate and nearly 4 times greater than the annual estimated tax rate as per the XXXX property assessment value calculation. 

However, this incorrect amount was used to determine the alleged shortage, the required low point and other calculations resulting in a new Escrow payment amount of {$320.00}, an increase from {$160.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

On, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my account representative via phone and he stated that he would look into it but never followed up. I proceeded to contact Fay Servicing again on XX/XX/XXXX and was transferred to a new account manager who told me that the {$2500.00} tax was charged by the City of XXXX and that Fay Servicing simply paid it. I was told to contact the City of XXXX for a tax receipt and Fay Servicing would gladly correct any discrepancies and refund any charges. However, the representative did not offer to furnish any payment receipt ( s ) made by Fay Servicing. 

I contacted the City of XXXX Revenue Dept. and received an e-mail response on XX/XX/XXXX from a Revenue Collection representative clarifying that the property has and active Tax Abatement and that NO taxes were PAID nor DUE for the years XXXX and XXXX. 

I contacted Fay Servicing again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with yet another new account manager. As per our conversation, she informed me that she recently acquired the account and was unaware of the issue. She then searched to find that the issue was under review as of XX/XX/XXXX and was not sure when I would receive an update but stated, maybe in 5 days. She also facetiously replied that theres something called a pandemic going on right now and that things are busy. I completely understand. Ironically, Fay Servicing denied me Economic Hardship Assistance due to COVID-19 because the the investors decided that my loan doesnt qualify. 

As of the date of this writing I have yet to receive any correspondence from a Fay Servicing LLC representative regarding this Escrow issue."

It is important to clarify that this request is not due to any error or negligence on my part. There has been no oversight or misunderstanding on my end.

Debt collection,"I am writing in reference to the account listed under my name that you claim has been charged off and is still being pursued for collection. I respectfully request verification of this debt and clarification on the following legal points under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S. Code 1692g, and relevant tax laws.

If this account was charged off by the original creditor, it was likely declared as a loss for tax purposes under IRS regulation 26 U.S. Code 166 ( Bad Debts Deduction ). This indicates the creditor may have received a tax benefit by writing off the debt as uncollectible. If so, I request documentation proving : 1. The amount that was written off ; 2. Whether the original creditor or subsequent owner took a tax deduction ; 3. Whether the debt was forgiven, sold, or transferred. 

A charge-off is an internal accounting movenot a legal judgment. You are still required to validate the debt under the FDCPA, and I assert my right to receive full verification before any further collection attempts continue. 

Additionally, if the debt was sold, I request the legal contract showing your ownership and the amount paid. If the debt was forgiven or included in a 1099-C tax cancellation notice, I request documentation of that as well, which may indicate the debt is no longer legally collectible. 

Please cease all collection activities until full validation has been provided. Continued attempts to collect without verification are a violation of federal law."

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Note : This complaint was previously submitted on XX/XX/2019 ( XXXX ). Despite appeals to Bank of America and CFPB, I got only the standard response and no redress. I had given up except for what I have read since the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX protests from last summer -- minority voice suppression via redlining, consequent credit damage and hiding behind fine print legalese to thwart responsibility of financial institutions. As a XXXX XXXX, I wonder if I have been given the same treatment by Bank of America. I hope your office will look at my complaint again from a civil rights perspective. 

To recap, the Overdraft protection ( Line of Credit ) covered a {$200.00} shortfall in my Checking account. A transfer of {$10000.00} was made from our Savings account to our Checking account the next day assuming all is now well. Without a noticeable alert or warning from the Bank, the {$200.00} overdrawn amount in the Line of Credit incurred interest of just {$10.00} over 81 days when I got a delinquency call and I rushed and paid off the amount. However, my credit score took an instant drastic hit from about 840 to around 700 as a result. It will take me several years to get my credit standing back. 

It is unfair of Bank of America to continue such usurious practices. Of course, the public be XXXX  when Banks with assets of {$1.00} XXXX or more accounted for {$11.00} XXXX in overdraft fees in 2019, according to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

The next day I faxed the cover letter, police report, and the letter XXXX XXXX sent me indicating the credit card inquiry was fraudulent. Once they received this information they began a reinvestigation which concluded on XX/XX/XXXX. They said as a result of their reinvestigation, they have closed the account. However, the account they are referring too was an old account I had that I personally closed on XX/XX/XXXX. They did not remove the inquiry made on XX/XX/XXXX which was the whole purpose of the reinvestigation, which I had outlined for them in the cover letter I faxed them. 

I had called them back after all of this and they told me that I have to have the creditor reach out to them and they will remove the inquiry. I told them that they should have received the letter since I received mine. However they were not budging and refused to take the inquiry off unless they get notification from XXXX XXXX, even though I had all the documentation proving it was a fraudulent inquiry. At this point, I am very frustrated as I have called them 8 times regarding this and every time I speak to someone I am told to do something different. 

I then called XXXX XXXX Security Operations who sent them an Immediate Emergency Credit Deletion Request on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told it can take 24-48 hours for them to receive this information. On XX/XX/XXXX, a little over a week later, I called back Equifax to see if they have received the notification, and once again they did not. At this point, I called XXXX XXXX Security Operations again and they told me they will submit another request, but it should have been received by Equifax already. If they do not receive it in another week or so there isn't anything else they can do but send yet another request. I am completely at my witts end with Equifax and their lack of customer service and complete incompetence with removing a simple inquiry that is clearly fraudulent. 

Not only are they making it very difficult for me to remove this inquiry It seems as though I have to tell them how to do their job since the woman I spoke with, XXXX, told me she could not find anything in my file or tell me anything about it because there is nothing there, I told her, since I have spoken to many representatives and supervisors, that she is able to look into my file and see the documentation I provided, which she later did. She also had the nerve to tell me the police report did not document the inquiry, which in fact it did and they told me it was not a valid report because it was not hard stamped with a seal. It is incredibly frustrating when there is a company such as Equifax that handles very important information and they cant even do a simple job correctly. I am hoping you can offer any assistance in this matter because I can not keep fighting with them much longer. 

I am attaching the letter from the creditor that had been sent to me, the police report, and the cover letter I faxed them. I am also attaching screenshots, one showing the results of the most recent reinvestigation and the other showing the inquiry still listed on my credit report."

Debt collection,"Hi. I'm wanting to let you know about a situation that just happened yesterday with Waypoint. Waypoint is a collection agency. They are collecting on XXXX however that company no longer exists. The company is now named XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Today I checked my credit report and I saw Waypoint listed as 1 of only 2 collections. 1 of those collections I didn't recognize so I decided to dispute it but I did have a XXXXe account in the past so I decided I would at least call Waypoint to find out what was going on. I spoke to a woman named XXXX XXXX. She was a very nice collector. She informed me that this was for a bill for services. She informed me that according to the records on file, I last paid XX/XX/XXXX but services were cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX. She said this bill was for those charges. I know I'm not a perfect individual, but I remember cancelling services with XXXX and going in person to turn the equipment in almost immediately. I know for a fact that I asked at the moment of turning my equipment in if there were any additional fees. I was told no. As any person would do after being told they didn't have any money owed, I went about my business and moved on with my life. 

Here we are 2 years later and I check my XXXX XXXX to ensure that my credit report is accurate and I see this account on my report. I explained to XXXX that I didn't owe any money to XXXX ; and if I did, why didn't they ever bill me or call me about this debt? XXXX went on to explain that her company had sent me a bill this past XX/XX/XXXX. She said she sent it to a XXXX XXXX address. Unfortunately, I don't live at the XXXX XXXX address. I informed her of that fact and XXXX went on to explain that is why I didn't know about the bill. She said that is also why I didn't receive a bill from XXXX either. I could almost understand her logic but I had to correct her because it was based on a faulty premise. It is true that I no longer live at the XXXX XXXX address now, but I did live there for a little over a year from the date she stated I made my last payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I lived there until XX/XX/XXXX. In other words, I lived at XXXX XXXX 1 year and 1 month after I made my last payment to XXXX. That meant XXXX had ample opportunity to bill me or notify me in any way that I owed them money but they didn't. I explained that to XXXX and what I hear next is what really pushed me over the edge. 

Not only was I in collections for a bill that I never knew I owed, but XXXX went on to state that around that same time, XXXX was being bought out by XXXX XXXX/ XXXX and there was going to be delays and confusion. She said it took time for XXXX to figure out what was going on and then take over. I somewhat understood that so I offered her to pay this account off to avoid any lengthy disputes and investigations in exchange for having this account removed from my credit report due to no billing or by her own admission, billing errors. She refused. She stated that her company has to report accurately and what would be the point of the credit bureau if she removed this account. She also admitted that other companies delete accounts but her company doesn't. I then informed her that the reporting of this account is not accurate. Placing an account on my credit report as a collection is akin to letting the world know that I refused to pay a bill when that is not the case. By her own admission XXXX bought XXXX and it took them a while to dig through all the records and figure out what's going on. She also said that it seemed like XXXX threw their hands up during this time and pretty much gave up since they were being bought out. 

How am I supposed to accept this as a consumer? How am I supposed to accept this as a person? From my point of view, I'm being led to believe that because a company decided to sell itself to someone else then I am being held responsible for their lack of record keeping or improper billing. That I am going to for the next 7 years be labeled as a consumer that doesn't pay his bills to any future creditor. How is that fair? Because of that I asked to speak to a supervisor. I ended up being transferred to a XXXX XXXX. To make this complaint shorter, I went through the same conversation with her and also asked her to delete this account for the same reasons. XXXX refused because she claimed that she sent the mail trough a special means with the USPS that supposedly would have the mail reach me even if the mail was sent to a wrong address. Well it didn't. We went through a whole dance of me stating facts and her putting up abstract objections such as millions of people get their mail from the post office we don't know why you didn't or XXXX should have billed you we don't know why they didn't. In the end, she also refused to remove this account from my credit report even thought it was confirmed that XXXX was bought out by XXXX and the buyout caused record problems. It was confirmed that Waypoint sent mail to a wrong address. It was confirmed that Waypoint had never spoken to me about this debt. It was confirmed that I made initial communication upon discovering this on my credit report and I was the one who offered to pay this debt in exchange for a simple courtesy removal of this account from the credit report due to the multiple errors committed by XXXX, XXXX, and Waypoint. Even after all that she refused. To this day I have never received a bill or a phone call about this debt. And because I turned in my equipment to XXXX in person and they told me I didn't owe them any more money, I don't even know if this bill is even owed! 

I am now asking you to please look into this because I am losing my faith as a consumer. Companies are being bought out or merging constantly anymore and if these are the results I can expect anytime something like this happens, how am I supposed to maintain a good credit score or do business with these companies in good faith?"

Mortgage,"Opened Wells Fargo Home Equity Line around XXXX. 
Never missed a payment. 
Over the years, have had problems having my payments posted. These problems occured using various payments methods and paying at different banks. Had many occasions where bank staff did not know how to process payments. I was eventually told to instruct Wells Fargo staff to process the payments as a "" regular payment ''. This worked for some time, but unfortunately did not last. 

The past 3 months : XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX my payments were not posted. Payments were made from the Wells Fargo App using my Wells Fargo checking account and paid directly to the Wells Fargo Home Equity account. Payments were made well in advance of the due date. 

I have begun to get calls stating that my account is delinquent, Outrageous interest payments have been requested. Every time I go through this process I am not believed and have been harassed to make my payment even though payment already has been made. 

When I checked my XXXX payment amount it was incorrect again. I called and spoke with a woman who said she saw the problem and would resolve it. A week later, I received a call stating that I was past due. I once again explained the situation and the gentleman said he would resolve it immediately. 

When I received the "" corrected payment amount '' for XXXX, I paid it immediately although it still seemed much higher than normal. After I made that payment, I notice my XXXX payment amount decreased to the normal payment. I then received another call stating that my account was past due. I explained to the gentleman that I had indeed made the payment and I wanted my additional amount credited to Principle, not interest. He said that the additional amount paid would be paid to interest. I responded by stating that was not correct and asked for documentation that the payment would be processed as I requested. No response received. 

Now my XXXX statement reflected no payment in XXXX at all. I received another call stating that I was past due. I tried to explain the situation but was dismissed. I instructed the gentlemen that he needed to check as I was up to date. 

As of today, My new payment for XXXX is still not correct. I do not want to make a payment as I am confident that the additional amounts they are charging will be applied to interest and not toward principal.

Debt collection,"Credit Collection Services sent me a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they were attempting to collect a debt of {$1400.00} on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I responded the day I received notice, stating that I had paid the owed amount of {$1300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

CCS sent me a statement from XXXX with transactions dated between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which did not report the payment I made. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I uploaded onto CCS 's website Proof of Payment form XXXX XXXX, verifying an electronic payment of {$1300.00} to XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. 

During a recorded phone call, CCS ' supervisor confirmed receipt of my docs, confirmed that XXXX received the payment and did not record it, but said he had to report the past due amount to the credit reporting agencies anyway. I told him not to and that I was disputing the debt and had supplied all the documents CCS had requested.

CCS falsely reported an unpaid debt to XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, to all three credit bureaus, negatively impacting my credit rating."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I, XXXX XXXX, am writing to file a complaint against XXXX ( formerly, XXXX ) for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) in relation to the inaccurate reporting of my car loan payments. 

I entered into a written agreement with XXXX for a payment deferment on my car loan. However, despite this agreement, XXXX has reported my loan payments as late to credit reporting agencies, causing damage to my credit score and hindering my ability to utilize the banking system fairly. 

In accordance with the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( B ), XXXX is required to report my loan payment history with accuracy and fairness, and to take appropriate steps to resolve any disputes regarding the completeness or accuracy of the information provided. 

Additionally, the FCBA, 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( a ), requires that credit card issuers and other creditors accurately report account information to credit reporting agencies. Furthermore, XXXX is in violation of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) and FCBA, 15 U.S.C. 1666i, which indicate that upon a written and signed deferment agreement between the lender and borrower, the payment history is supposed to be current without any late payments. 
I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau take immediate action to correct the inaccuracies on my credit report, and that XXXX be held accountable for their failure to report my loan payments in accordance with the law. Specifically, I request that my credit report be updated to reflect the "" current status- never late '' and that any late payment history be deleted from my credit report based on the deferment agreement. 

I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter and I am available to provide any additional information or documentation that may be required. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","There is a hard inquiry on my Experian credit report that does not belong to me. I contacted the company who reported it, I was told by one of their representatives that someone applied for a business loan using my information. I added a fraud alert to my credit report and sent Experian a  certified letter XX/XX/2020 and haven't heard anything back. I asked the company to remove it and they said that it has to be investigated they don't remove it. Here is the company 's address : US SM BUS ADMIN XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Reported XX/XX/2020 XX/XX/XXXX"
Mortgage,"Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) acquired my note from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. When they acquired the note, my city 's services ( City Of XXXX ) was making payments on my behalf since I have been out of work and in a re-training program. XXXX asked SLS to forward them a XX/XX/XXXX W-9 form with the address where the payments should be made out to and sent. This is required by the Federal gov't to show where the XXXX sent payments to that address and the payments were credited to my account. The form was forwarded that included the address and payments were being made on time and SLS credited those payments to my account. Then in XX/XX/XXXX the payments were not being credited to the account. When calling to inquire, SLS claimed they were not receiving payments. This was not true. When explaining that payments had been received and applied up until now to the address provided on the W-9, SLS claimed that it was the incorrect address. When asking SLS to send a W-9 with the correct address, they said they would however it was never sent but XXXX still made payments on my behalf that were sent and SLS applied those payments. 


Prior to the start of the new year, XXXX requested SLS forward over a XX/XX/XXXX W-9 form to continue making payments on my behalf. It took several months until a Ms. XXXX sent XXXX the new form. There was absolutely no mistake about XXXX 's request to Ms. XXXX regarding the reason for the form. I spoke w/a rep ( which I recorded ) who confirmed she spoke with Ms. XXXX XXXX and confirmed the address on the W-9 was correct. Payments were sent over to the address on the XX/XX/XXXX W-9 but the checks were not being cashed nor being applied to my account. Inquiring with SLS claimed that they never received the checks and that the address on the W-9 form was incorrect. Speaking with XXXX ( teller agent ID  # XXXX ) recorded on XX/XX/XXXX, told me that SLS has MULTIPLE W-9 forms that she would investigate to see which W-9 would be the correct one and get back with me. XXXX did get back with me on XX/XX/XXXX and informed me that the W-9 form that Ms. XXXX sent, although having the incorrect address to send payments to, could not be changed. 

HOWEVER, according to my last statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) SOME of the checks were cashed and applied to my account but SLS is still claiming that they never received any checks. There are also funds that were sent that are sitting in a suspense account ( per my XX/XX/XXXX statement ) waiting to be credited ( see most recent statement, attached ). If SLS has not received these payments then my statement would not reflect the suspense funds nor the other credits. 

In the meantime, I was sent a "" Default and notice to Foreclose '' notice that would be initiated if the past due funds ( {$3200.00} ) were not satisfied within 33 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ). It should also be noted that the government COVID19 forbearance ends XX/XX/XXXX. I am also being charged inspection fees. 

When trying to call and get a resolution I am consistently stone-walled and given the run around. Teller agent XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) told me in order to get a resolution to fix the problem, I needed to speak with a "" XXXX '' in the Escalations Dept. After calling several times I was told that manager "" XXXX '' would call me back. I'm still waiting and have been dealing with this issue and attempting a resolution for over 8 months and do not wish to default on my loan when clearly there are payments being made and seen. 

It is my belief that Specialized Loan Servicing is choosing NOT to work toward a resolution to allow third party payments by NOT providing an appropriate W-9 form as they did for XX/XX/XXXX and INTENTIONALLY allowing the checks from XXXX to expire past 90 days in order to force a foreclosure to acquire the property based upon property values for my geographic area. 

Also, it should be noted that as of XX/XX/XXXX, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reached a settlement with Specialized Loan Servicing LLC, where the consent order requires the business to pay {$1.00} million in monetary relief to consumers in the form of redress and waiver of borrower deficiencies, pay a {$250000.00} civil money penaltyand implement procedures to ensure compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) and its implementing regulation, Regulation X. 

The CFPB found that since XX/XX/XXXX, the lender violated RESPA and Regulation X by taking prohibited foreclosure actions against mortgage borrowers who were entitled to protection from foreclosure, and by failing to send or to timely send evaluation notices to mortgage borrowers who were entitled to them. These violations also constitute violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. In some cases, Specialized Loan Servicing 's violations of Regulation X short-circuited protections for consumers whose homes were ultimately foreclosed upon.

Mortgage,"I have been going through the foreclosure process since XX/XX/XXXX. When we first obtained the loan the lender reassured me I would be able to refinance my loan after one year of making the original payment which was {$5600.00}. They told me that I would need to do this in order for me to get a better rate which would bring down my payment dramatically. When the time came to refinance they told me I could n't and soon after I found out they filed bankruptcy and sold my loan to another company. I stopped making payments because I found a company who said they would help me with a loan modification and they told me in order for me to qualify for a modification I would need to stop making payments because the lender said there was no reason for the modification because I was not delinquent. We were having a difficult time making the payments of {$5600.00} and thought this would be a good idea to help us alleviate some of the burden. After 3 months of non-payment we found out that the company we paid to help with the modification was a fraud and the lender will not help us with the modification. That then put us into panic mode. I tried calling the lender and they told me they will not accept any payments and sent back my check. We searched the web looking for help then we came across a company, known as XXXX XXXX, owned by XXXX XXXX, who said they would buy my house and rent it back to, we paid them {$12000.00} and soon found out they were also scammers. Then we met up with XXXX XXXX and paid her XXXX to help us fight our mortgage company because they believed the company trying to foreclose on us did not own the loan and no one has the original papers to foreclose on us. 
My loan has been transferred 4 times within a 6 month period. I have tried to apply for a loan modification with each lender but each time my loan documents was always getting lost. Finally, with the current servicer Maddision Management they received all my documents but I was recently denied saying my income will not be sufficient and my arrears was way to high and they could n't come up with a payment affordable for us, which I will appeal. 
The bank that was originally foreclosing on us was XXXX XXXX and now we found out that the investors have changed and we do not know who the rightful owners of the loan are. The companys who are involved now are XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and Maddision Management Services. I have not received any Statements from anyone but Madison Management Company since my loan was owned by XXXX Mortgage. The statements I receive are dated for today but they are asking for payment in year XX/XX/XXXX. Statements are not current. Also year ending XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a Cancellation of Debt form which I have attached for your viewing. They are still making me liable for that amount. 
I feel harassed by my lender, they send people to my house to take pictures of the house. They enter my property without permission. Two weeks ago someone entered our property and my children were home. They were scared because they did not know who was walking around. My son went out to ask who they were and they did n't answer. They just kept taking pictures of the house and walking around. Even though I am in foreclosure they should still respect us as human beings and not freak my kids out. They come to my house at least once a month and take pictures, not only from the street but up close and on my property. My kids called my crying and saying there 's people here mom, what do we do? This is totally unfair and disrespectful."
Mortgage,"XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I applied for a Heloc through my lender 's app. Guaranteed Rate. I was denied. I called XXXX to inquire as to why I was declined. I have excellent ( over XXXX ) credit scores. I have very little debt. When a man ( XXXX ) answered, he put me on hold and when he came back after checking on my application, said I was declined due to "" a county land use code that we do not accept. '' I had never heard of such a thing and asked for more information. He said the code was "" NEC or Not elsewhere classified '' and that they don't do loans on properties with that code. I said I lived in a residential neighborhood in a single family home, and asked what would be considered a "" normal ' code. He replied single family. I said that I thought there was some mistake. He said I would need to call my county to get it corrected. We hung up.

I called the County assessors office and spoke with XXXX She confirmed with her superior that my property is indeed coded with the county as "" Single Family Residence ''. She offered to email me the property card to send on to the processor at Gauranteed rate. She did email that to me and we hung up. I called back immediately to the above XXXX number for guaranteed rate. This time after waiting for an answer for 15 minutes I spoke with "" XXXX ''. I told him that I had an email proving that my property was not coded as NEC, but Single Family. He said there was nothing he could do. The information they get can not be changed. I asked how that is legal. They are offering financial loans to the public but they don't have to use correct information to process that person 's application? That doesn't seem right. I asked for a superior to call me back. He said there is no one that is a superior. That he literally had nothing other he could do for me. I again asked how I was to correct this mistaken information if the county had nothing to change? I asked to send him the property card by email. He said that there would be nothing he could do with the corrected information or the property card and the final comment he had was that this happens to A LOT of people that are applying and there is literally nothing they can do. This sounds like a company that has an algorithm set up in their approval data to lend to only a certain demographic that maybe my neighborhood is not part of."

Debt collection,"I am submitting a formal complaint regarding an inaccurate debt reported by Amsher Collection Services ( Amsher ) that originated from XXXX. The debt is being wrongfully reported and has caused significant harm to my credit score, despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue directly with both XXXX  and previous debt collectors. I believe there have been violations of both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as well as issues regarding unfair billing practices by XXXX 

Summary of the Issue : XXXX. Inaccurate Debt : I transferred my mobile service from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, which effectively terminated my XXXX service on that date. However, XXXX continued to bill me for services I did not receive after the transfer. Specifically, I received a bill for {$85.00} covering services from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX practice is to bill monthly in advance, and instead of crediting me for the unused service from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX instead wrongfully billed me for a full additional month of service and claimed that I owed them the full amount along with unjustified late fees. 

XXXX. Failure to Resolve and Identify : I made several attempts to resolve this billing error with XXXX. However, I was unable to access my account information because XXXX customer service refused to identify me through any method other than a PIN, which I did not recall. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue, XXXX wrongfully sent the account to collections, adding late fees and charges to the inaccurate bill. 

XXXX. Reselling of the Debt : I initially disputed the debt with XXXX XXXX Strategies, who sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, and I submitted a dispute electronically via their website on XX/XX/XXXX. After my dispute, XXXX failed to respond but instead added a collection account to my credit report. I successfully disputed this with XXXX, and the collection was removed in or around XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced by the lack of appearance of a collection account listed by XXXX on my credit report. However, I discovered that the debt was subsequently sold to Amsher when they reported it to my credit file in XX/XX/XXXX. This effectively reset the timeline on the debt collection process, forcing me to dispute the same inaccurate debt again. 

XXXX. Failure to Notify : Amsher has failed to notify me of their legal authority to collect the debt or provide me with a notification of my right to dispute the debt, as required by the FDCPA. The only indication of this debts assignment to Amsher was its appearance on my credit report. This is a clear violation of the FDCPAs requirement to provide written notice within XXXX days of the initial contact. 

XXXX. Damage to My Credit : This inaccurate debt has negatively impacted my credit score, which was previously 820. The reporting of this erroneous debt has caused a significant and unjust decline in my credit rating, despite my consistent efforts to resolve the dispute. I do not owe this debt. It stems from an incorrect bill issued by XXXX after my service was terminated. I however have no ability to dispute this debt directly with XXXX as they have written off the amount and will only refer me to the latest collections agency. I therefore remain at the mercy of Amsher and can not explain the original problem to them as they have nothing to do with XXXX billing practices. This account has already been written off twice by both the original creditor, XXXX, as well as XXXX and it is unreasonable and unfair for Amsher to report this as a collection account as of XX/XX/XXXX thereby restarting the clock in terms of the length of time that this derogatory remark can remain on my credit report and forcing me to dispute it all over again. 

Attachments : Copy of the bill from XXXX for services after termination dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
Copy of the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
Copy of my correspondence disputing the debt with XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

I trust that you will investigate this matter promptly and take the necessary steps to resolve this wrongful debt collection and credit reporting. Thank you for your attention to this matter."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2023, I called the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX to settle student debt ( not federal or private loan ) in the amount of {$6000.00}. I was told by XXXX of the cashiers office that the debt was turned over to S & S Recovery ( XXXX ). I called XXXX & XXXX XXXX and was connected to XXXX at extension XXXX, who happened to be the representative handling my case. XXXX advised me that I owed {$1500.00} in addition to the {$6000.00}. Baffled, I questioned the additional fees. XXXX advised me that the additional fees were late fees assessed by XXXX XXXX. This immediately presented a red-flag because I had just spoken to XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX spoken to a representative at the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX prior, XX/XX/2023. XXXX assured me that the additional fees only came from XXXX XXXX  when they had taken over the account. I told XXXX that I would call her back at her extension in XXXX to XXXX minutes so that I could verify some information. 

I immediately called the XXXX University XXXX XXXX to verify the information provided to me by XXXX. XXXX answered the phone and was distraught by the information I had received from XXXX. XXXX stated that the information provided by XXXX was completely false and that XXXX University had assessed no additional fees onto my student account. XXXX stated that the additional {$1500.00} fee was apparently assessed onto my student account by XXXX & XXXX XXXX. XXXX stated that I owed XXXX University {$6000.00} and that no additional fees were assessed. I told XXXX that XXXX knowingly, willfully, and deliberately lied to me about the additional fee and was using XXXX University as a scapegoat to force collection efforts on me and possibly other students. XXXX readily named XXXX as my S & S Recovery representative and stated that she was going to give her a call. XXXX stated that if needed, she would get additional contacts involved in an effort to remedy the situation. XXXX asked if she could call me back while she attempted to make contact with XXXX. At XXXX XXXX on said date, XXXX XXXX me back advising that she had spoken to XXXX XXXX extension XXXX. I am unaware of the contents of the conversation, but XXXX urged that I give XXXX a call at the aforementioned extension. I attempted to contact XXXX at XXXX thereby leaving a voicemail message, and again at XXXX without success. At XXXX XXXX, I called XXXX & XXXX XXXX at XXXX and left a message for XXXX XXXX a receptionist. At present, I have not received return correspondence from XXXX or any other representative of XXXX & XXXX XXXX. 

It is based upon reasonable belief as a retired law enforcement official that S & S Recovery is assessing unreasonable collection fees on XXXX XXXX  XXXX accounts under the fraudulent guise that such fees are late fees assessed by XXXX XXXX. S & S Recovery representatives are knowingly providing materially false and fabricated information to unsuspecting students who may not have the means to challenge the additional fees. It is highly unlikely that a reasonable and prudent person would believe that I am the only XXXX XXXX  student subject to such vile conduct by XXXX & XXXX XXXX. Based on my legal and law enforcement background, I hereby request that the CFPB conduct a full and thorough investigation on S & S Recovery collection activities with regard to my XXXX XXXX  student account, in addition to all other student accounts associated with XXXX XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX : Mortgage statement received stating two payments were made to our loan totaling XXXX with no payment due in XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Payment made via auto pay to Freedom Mortgage in the amount of XXXX for our XXXX statement as I assumed the statement from XX/XX/XXXX was an error. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Three letters received from Freedom mortgage simultaneously stating we were delinquent on our loan in the amount of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : I spoke with XXXX at Freedom mortgage stating a software issue affecting our account shows a reversal of two mortgage payments on XX/XX/XXXX to our XXXX XXXX account causing the account to become delinquent. I confirmed with XXXX XXXX no funds were transferred back into our account from Freedom mortgage at any time within the last two years. XXXX stated he would send both a statement of payments to our mortgage within the last two years as well as an email stating we were not delinquent on our account for the credit bureaus to my personal email. That evening it was confirmed both my wife and I suffered a steep decline in our credit reports by upwards of 94 points due to this error with Freedom mortgage. We filed complaints with all three credit bureaus. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I confirmed that our Freedom mortgage account was showing we were still behind by one mortgage payment and submitted an additional payment to the loan to protect myself from being reported again. That would place an additional payment to our loan that we did not want to make as it does create a financial hardship for us. Contacted Freedom mortgage and spoke with XXXX. She also stated it was a software issue with Freedom mortgage causing XXXX  customers to be affected. I asked for a return payment to my account in the amount of XXXX as I have now made an over payment in addition to a certified letter stating we were not delinquent on our account and that a software issue occurred. I have not received either. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Contacted XXXX  XXXX to file a formal complaint as I am now missing XXXX in funds. Spoke with XXXX and claim was filed. 3-way call was started between XXXX XXXX and Freedom mortgage. Spoke with XXXX at Freedom Mortgage who was informed by XXXX that no funds were returned to our account on XX/XX/XXXX or at any time by Freedom mortgage. XXXX was relieved from call at which time XXXX stated I would need to mail my bank statements to a XXXX XXXX . I was uncomfortable with this request and asked to speak with a supervisor. Transferred to XXXX XXXX email XXXX XXXX freedommortgage.com who stated I would need to send the XXXX statements to her email account so that she could confirm funds were not transferred back into the account and to correct our negative reports with the credit bureaus. Email sent but no response receipt of confirmation has been received. I have no spent a total of 7 hours trying to resolve this issue. Each time I have to explain the concern as no one seems to have any of this information on my loan file."
Debt collection,I checked my credit report and I seen this account in collection for {$3200.00} for an old apartment My Ex boyfriend and I had together. When I turned in the keys to the apartment my ex boyfriend made payment arrangements with the office and the total owed was only {$2200.00}. I thought this was taken care of by my ex. I attempted to email the debt collector requesting verification my email was returned and it said it was undelivered and it was the correct email I got off from there website. However I was never contacted by this debt collector I was never given an opportunity to dispute or get verification of debit. I just want to avoid legal action because right on there website it says they will sue anybody if they do n't pay. As a consumer I know I have rights and I feel this debt collector is not following the law.
Mortgage,"In XXXX my father passed away and left the house that he had a mortgage on to me in his will that went through legal probate and the house was transferred to me through the courts. My husband and I never re-financed the loan into our names for we were not informed to do so it was my thought the mortgage would be legally put into our names by XXXX who at the time has the servicing of the loan. They informed us that we could do a loan modification and then after a few months told us that was not possible because we were not on the loan, then they suggested assuming the loan and again after a few months told us the at loan was not assumable. The Truth-In- Lending only states not assumable by a buyer, we were not buyers but legal heirs by law. Then my husband and I filed Ch XXXX Bankruptcy to avoid foreclosure by XXXX. Then it was sold to Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc, and we have dealing with them now for 2 years and getting the same run around. We hired a company to help us with reconstructing the loan into our names at a lower interest rate so that we could start making payments. We were not making payments for the mortgage was under a deceased persons SS # and we would not get the interest tax break. It was not for a lack of trying to get this loan into our names. Now SPS has set a foreclosure date for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will not postpone even though we received a letter on the XXXX or XXXX of XXXX telling us they have receive our inquiry and would be contact with us within 20 days of receiving the information which would be the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. After speaking with a manager of SPS along with an analyst of the company we hired to help us with this we were told the sale was going forward on the XXXX and that the letter we received is a computer generated letter that is printed whenever data is entered into the computer that new documentation has been received. This is a deceptive practice on the part of the loan servicing bank and should be illegal. This gives the people facing foreclosure false and misleading hope. Even the XXXX the analyst with the company that we hired agreed. Our house is still for foreclosure on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and SPS had the power to stop it to look over the documents and did not do so. This is wrong."

Debt collection,"I visited a XXXX XXXX XXXX rental property to inquire about availability, as I could not find sufficient info online. I was informed they did not accept online applications for the property, it had to be completed in office. A tour of XXXX XXXX  was done and then we returned back to the leasing office. The leasing agent asked if we wanted to proceed with the application, we agreed. We were given a sheet of paper to provide our income and personal info so a credit and background check could be performed. We were advised we should hear back within XXXX hours as it was a Saturday when we completed the application. We paid {$400.00} in application fees to start the background check. The next business day we were denied approval. It was understood the application fee was nonrefundable. The property reached out to say they have reconsidered and want to offer us the unit however we had already received the denial so we went on to move into a property that had already approved us. We did NOT agree to move into XXXX XXXX. No deposit was paid, no keys were given. The day of signing the application to authorizes the checks, the leasing agent sneakily had us sign a lease. I have documents to show that the page we signed does not state lease, we were led to believe we were signing the application, only. The leasing agent completed the upper portion of the document, shown in XXXX XXXX, where the leasing agreement title is boldly stated. This was not shown to us nor were we provided with a copy of said lease before leaving the property. It was not something of immediate concern but we were not aware a lease was signed. We do not typically receive documentation after an application is complete. I had to request the documents be sent to me, as they were not proactively offered. The property later reported myself and my partner to collections for roughly {$5000.00} because we decided not to move in. There was NO agreement to move in, we only applied. I feel this collection reporting is unfair and dishonest. Furthermore, the alleged lease we signed off on is not the unit we agreed to. The property changed the unit without approval and this in itself would void the contract. Their document states no modifications are valid unless in writing and signed by both parties. If this is true, how can it work in the properties favor but not in the consumer 's? It should work both ways. We did not sign any documents with updated terms."

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, NewRez received my payment and inexplicably applied it as "" escrow only '', then charged late fees on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I caught them on XX/XX/XXXX so they corrected the misaplied funds before late fees kicked in. 

They corrected the XXXX error on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX error on XX/XX/XXXX and the XX/XX/XXXX error on XX/XX/XXXX. What they did not do is account for my interest paid during these gaps, so they are pocketing the benefit of their error. 

Note that principal adjustments on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX only account for the fact that I paid more than the minimum payment. These amounts do not account for the interest charged during the error periods. 

I suspect this is a common practice for this company to earn money at the expense of the consumer. Some consumers may even pay the penalties or panic and pay additional payments. Who knows. None of the customer service agents I had the pleasure of speaking to could explain why a payment would be credited to "" escrow only '' before applying to principal and interest.

Debt collection,"Re : Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC Acct # : XXXX Dear Sir/Madam : I want to make a formal complaint. I have filed several disputes with Portfolio Recovery Associates , LLC. They had failed to validate an account under the Federal Debt Credit Practice Act. Portfolio Recovery Associates , LLC. failed to delete the inaccurate information between myself and Portfolio Recovery Associates , LLC. due to non-compliance. 
The Federal Debt Credit Practice Act specifically states : 15 USC 1692g ( b ) DISPUTED DEBTS If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection ( a ) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor. Any collection activities and communication during the 30-day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumers right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor. 
The Federal Credit Reporting Act specifically states : 15 USC 1681 s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate It appears that Portfolio Recovery Associate LLC have a constant habit of non-compliance of not validation my alleged account, not replying to my dispute and reporting inaccurate information. 
I see you recently filed a complaint with Virginia XXXX XXXX against Portfolio Recovery Associates for their illegal debt collection and credit reporting violations. 
Case # XXXX Portfolio Recovery Associates , LLC XXXX reporting such inaccurate information has caused severe damage to my character, my reputation, my general mode of living and my ability to obtain credit for personal and house purposes. 
This inaccurate reporting has damaged my livelihood. 
According to the law-the Federal Credit Reporting Act a consumer reporting agency must report maximum possible accurate information. 

This is a violation of the Federal Debt Credit Practice Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act by Portfolio Recovery Associates , LLC. I demand that this information be deleted from my consumer reports.

I have submitted all the paperwork and requested forms Mr. Cooper has asked for. I am at my wits end with them and need this funding in order to repair the rest of my house and everything that was damaged. Insurance issued the check to myself and Mr. Cooper to complete all approved repairs. Please help me and my family during this difficult time. We just want to get the work completed and be done dealing with the aftermath this storm has destroyed. Thank you.
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","TRANSUNION has ceased investigation of my credit report because, in their opinion, they believe that I have used a third party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to deliberate deny my 3rd Dispute request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA, Failing to provide a block within 4 days of being notified from a consumer who's been a victim of identity theft. Failing to provide accurate verification within 30 days of receiving a dispute. 

You were advised by me on XXXX by certified mail with a Police Report and affidavit from the Federal Trade Commission regarding fraudulent items appearing on my credit report. That request was written by me and mailed by me- not a third party agency. It appears obvious to me that you are abusing your power under the FCRA to escape a complete investigation. 

Here again is the incorrect information being reported ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 

Additionally there is NO law that states a consumer can not use a third party, so using that as your excuse is a irrelevant. In fact, the United States Congress has found the whole process so overwhelming that they afford consumers the right to use a third party on their behalf if the consumer so chooses. This is why your statement is so shameful. I reserve the right to sue a credit bureau for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I believe I can prove that you did not use reasonable measures to insure the accuracy of my credit reports and now you are stalling the process even further. I realize disputes can be expensive and it is your job to stall them, but you do so at great risk. Please take notice that this letter dated ( insert today 's date ) is formal notice to you that I am requesting that you continue forward with my original investigation request and please send the results to me within 15 days. I therefore legally and lawfully refuse your "" form letter '' thus giving you only 15 days not 30 more. 
I am annoyed and outraged at your accusation and I have researched my rights in regards to my credit file. Please expedite my original request immediately."

Debt collection,"Jefferson Capital has sent multiple letters and statements claiming that I owe them an amount of money that has yet deemed to be proven. I have never used Jefferson Capital, I have never received a service from them and I am being contacted frequently for collection of money for a debt that is not mine. I have disputed this account and Jefferson Capital has never shown any signed agreements or contracts with my signature. My credit report has been reported negatively due to false reporting of this unknown debt/account.

Mortgage,"My loan was with XXXX XXXX XXXX. My payments were {$540.00} a month. My taxes were n't included in my loan payments. I became {$1000.00} behind on my taxes. I decided to make payment arrangements with treasurer of the city of XXXX to get my payments up to date. The bank decided to take over the payments and raised my mortgage payments to {$780.00} a month. After three months it went down to {$730.00}. I started struggling with the payments. I became one month behind. The mortgage company sent me paperwork for a long modification. Instead of lowering my payments they raised my payment to {$830.00}. After a month of trying to pay that amount I called and told them I could not afford {$830.00}. I was then XXXX months behind. I was told by the mortgage company that the only other option was to move out and do a short sale or a deed in lieu. I decided to move out. I was told by the mortgage company that they could issue a short sale or a realtor was able to. I moved out of the house in XXXX 2014. I was told to let them know when I moved out. I called them in XXXX and I was told that XXXX XXXX XXXX would no longer be servicing my loan. Green tree would be taking over and I should probably give them until XXXX to get up to speed on my account. When I called in XXXX my account was still not in there system. It was closer to XXXX that I was fully in their system. When I mentioned the short sale to them they told me that 's not how they do it. I would have to list my house for sale and try to get regular price for the house. She said let 's try to do a modification. I told her that XXXX XXXX XXXX already denied me. She said my case was easy. She had seen a lot worse cases. She then denied my modification request after two months of sending in information. Now for six months I 've been trying to do a deed in lieu. I 've sent the same information in five or six times. I have no idea what 's going with the process. No one sends information. I had to look at my credit report to find out they foreclosed my house. But when I ask them has the house been foreclosed I 'm told no. They padlocked the door and I asked them Why are telling me to remove everything out of the house for the deed in lieu when you already padlocked and foreclosed on the house. They keep telling the house has n't been foreclosed, I feel like their trying to catch me off guard in order to prevent bankruptcy. I would have known the process would have taken this long I would have never left the house. In the beginning I wanted to keep the house, now I just want the process to be over with. This is like a slow death."

Unfortunately my license was suspended and expired at the time. The dealer told me I could not be on the loan, and my wife would more than likely not qualify by herself but they would try. The resubmitted the loan in just her name and she was approved. She went in and resigned in just her name only. We took the car home. I some what recently found that my name was in the loan. I could not be on the loan because my license was expired and suspended. I have tried multiple times to correct this via different avenues, but XXXX XXXX insist that there 's is not a mistake. They sent me a copy of all documents they had, in the documents was the contract i signed that wasnt valid because my licsense was suspened and expired, and a copy of my drivers license. That copy of my drivers license had a valid experation date, but you could clearly see that the date had been changed as it did not match the font of the rest of the drivers license. The dealership changed the date on my license and went with the first contract. The dealership commited fraud. When I spoke to them on the phone told them what happened and told them that it violates my rights, they said "" do n't throw around terms you do n't understand ''. They also said they only way they would consider removing the item from my credit was if I filled a police report. I call the city police department where I purchased the vehicle, because the loan was opened 10 years ago, they informed me that it was past the statute of limitations for fraud. I can not file a police report. I no longer have the license from 10 years ago. I asked XXXX if santander verified my identity, by verifying the sent documents? They said it 's not up to the lender to verify documents, that they took it on good faith from the dealership. They opened the account without verifying my identity, cause if they had verified it, they would have sent the contract back because my license was expired and suspended, and the documents did not match. Santander violated my rights by opening an account without verifying my identety. 

Santander nor XXXX have responded to me after they attempted to verify the debt with the fraudulent documents created by the the dealership, that they accepted without verification. The debt must be removed from my credit file as santander violated my consumer rights. 

Further more. If a creditor chooses to report to the credit companies, that information has to be 100 % accurate. All of my credit files are missing some payment information for the santander account. This is a violation of my rights, the item must be removed."

Debt collection,"I am filing this complaint against LVNV Funding LLC for reporting a {$650.00} collections account on my credit report without proper debt validation and for falsely identifying themselves as the original creditor. 

Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I exercised my right to request written validation of the alleged debt within 30 days of their initial contact. To date, LVNV and their servicing agent Resurgent Capital Services have failed to provide any documentation verifying the debt or their authority to collect it.

Furthermore, they have inaccurately listed themselves as the original creditor, which is misleading and deceptive under both the FDCPA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ). LVNV is a debt buyernot the original lenderand is not permitted to misrepresent their role."

Efforts to contact XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX ) via phone, email, and text have been met with consistent delays or no response, intensifying my frustration.

Recently, a collections agency claimed I owe approximately {$30000.00} for this course, compounding financial and emotional strain.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!! 
I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and XXXX XXXXXXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either XXXX, XXXX XXXX or Equifax respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I  believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to XXXX   XXXX. We must return to a common ground that is fair for all consumers in the United States, and we must be able to request additional marketing on our own terms. Accordingly, I am making a request for a free credit report with confirmation number to my attached email address. Thank you."

I dont believe its a mistake because there is no account to be found under my name. The way that this company finds me is under my daughter name which they have listed as the account primary holder. They clearly got the invoice from the original creditor with the person that need be pursued. I have a copy of the exact invoice and my name appears no where. I believe the went beyond the scope of the invoice to implicate me and thats not legal either. Even if it was a common mistake they should be more willing than they are to resolve the issue.

I was denied, however, I had to place a phone call to inquire about my cancellation request, I was never formally contacted. After speaking with Ocwen I was told to include an appraisal in my formal request, so I ordered an appraisal and spent {$500.00} to do so, and included this in my request. I was again denied and told I was denied because I did not use a certified appraiser, to which I directed them to the last page that showed the appraiser was a Utah Certified appraiser, then I was told this won't work because Ocwen did not order it. I then asked for a refund, to which they offered.

Then I was told to mail in a check for {$110.00} to have my PMI cancellation considered, and told that I needed to provide contractor receipts because the only way my PMI would be canceled is from improvements that I added, not because of the market increase. I did most of the work myself and was told this would not count. So, I did not send in a check and have been exploring my options, and I am currently shopping around to refinance my home."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I bought a kitchen suite from Best Buy. When it was time to pay I told the sales person that I was using two different cards, some on my Best Buy card but I only wanted to put like {$1200.00} on my bbcc so I didnt max my card out. He told me Im sure theyve given you an increase as I replied to him that they had not and I would know if they had. I told him to call Citi Bank to see if they would give me an increase, he swiped my card and over drew my account. I was furious when a few days later I noticed my XXXX lowered my credit limit to were its almost to the XXXX, XXXX did the same thing as well as XXXX XXXX. 
I had a credit score that was pretty good and I know Ive used my spending is getting high but Im trying to help my XXXX daughters which they both have XXXX yr olds, Covid isnt helping anymore anyone. The guy at Best Buy really messed my credit up and Im almost in tears every day because if I need to go buy a car for instance I cant. Not one person at Best Buy or Citi Bank even tried to compensate me which I could care less I want my credit fixed, I wasnt the one who messed it up but I have to fix it. I dont think people understand how hard it is to take care of this and watch XXXX babies. Please, Please tell me we can fix my credit! I told that guy what he needed to do and he didnt listen!"

Mortgage,"In XXXX of 2019 I attempted to get home improvement loan on my house. I discovered there were liens that had never been released. I did the work finding the people having those properly removed. I also discovered there was a second mortgage that was not paid ... the mortgage was in my husband 's name, he passed 7 years ago, I only knew of the one that I took over financially responsibility for. It took some digging around, but I found the lender that had the second mortgage. I was instructed to fax a request to settle the balance. I started on XX/XX/2019 with my first settlement offer, after a couple of week, it was declined. XX/XX/2019, I submitted another request, after a few weeks it was declined. XX/XX/2019, I submitted another request, I received another decline 2 weeks later. 
I spoke to a gentleman that advised me to go higher, when I submitted request for $ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I didn't hear anything and when I called I was told it was approved and just awaiting signature. Then I got a call that it was declined, they wanted the full amount owed. I said ok, I wish you would've just said that in the beginning. I then asked if they could just send me paperwork to assume responsibility of the loan and to do a modification. After a couple of weeks, I called back asking about modification package, he would say it was sent out. I would always ask if they could just email it to me, not it had to be mailed. weeks would go by and nothing, I called back and he finally gave me an excuse that it was returned. There is no way, the address is the same and we have the same postman. I asked if they were putting my husband 's name on it, again the postman knows I am still here so I don't know who would've returned it. I never saw proof of the return, we have community mailboxes, hopefully if it was put in wrong box my neighbor would bring it to me. They would email declination of offers to me, but they couldn't email the modification package?

Ive received emails and letters saying Im using a 3rd party which is incorrect because I am the one sending my letters out and filing this complaint with no help from a credit repair company or 3rd party.

I paid my XXXX property taxes myself but PHH servicing com raised my payment to $ XXXXmonth from $ XXXXmonth. I was unable to make this payment due to to life hardships. I tried for 5 months trying to resolve this issue by sending proofs of paid property taxes on time but i start getting notice loss mitigation and foreclosure notices. I spoke to their rep many times and they said give us 10 days to resolve this issue but no response from them. I had sent them paid property tax receipts by secure messages uploads at their web but no response. 
I requested PHH reps to send me a proof who authorized it to be a impound account. No response because it was unauthorized set up by PHH servicer. They said they had reimbursed me my property tax payments but i had never received any refund checks. I asked for proofs but no proof no response sent back. I am scared to death to loose my house. I need a thorough investigation in this matter.

I tried to report this to  XXXX, but they do not allow you to speak to a person. 

So in effect, Experian is violating the law by not allowing people access to a free report as guaranteed by law and pretending they are because they let you see it, but you can not actually save it. XXXX must be aware of this and facilitating Experian in their shenanigans."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","Dear Sir or Madam, *1. XXXX Account XXXX Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

I immediately disputed this information with XXXX and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

Debt collection,"I am submitting this statement in support of my dispute of care regarding my visit on XX/XX/year>. I arrived at the facility XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and at no point did I anticipate that this visit would be billed or treated as an XXXX XXXX  encounter. I even made my husband wait with me before we left the house while I looked up which facilities would be covered by my insurance to be 100 % sure we would be covered. I understand that I signed a form acknowledging the XXXX  billing transition ; however, I did not fully understand the implications at the time, and I do not believe the care I received warranted emergency-level billing or intervention. 
The physician I saw quickly moved toward the possibility of XXXX XXXX XXXX, stating that based on my pain, he believed XXXX might be needed. He ordered multiple tests, including an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. While he was professional in his tone, the verbiage he used caused my husband and me significant concern, and made us feel that a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
At one point in the night, he casually mentioned that XXXX or XXXX other patients were also having their XXXX XXXX that night, which felt odd and unsettling. It seemed to reinforce a narrative that XXXX XXXX was a likely and common next step for me, further amplifying XXXX XXXX He later recommended staying overnight for an XXXX but by that time, we no longer felt confident in the direction of care and chose to leave. 
Throughout the visit, I felt that my own input and perspective were being dismissed. I had just returned from XXXX less than 24 hours earlier, where I had been heavily bitten by mosquitos. I raised the possibility of XXXX XXXX, but the physician was dismissive of that suggestion. Even after discharge, I called back a few hours later to bring it up again, and he outright dismissed it. I ultimately spent XXXX hours vomiting at home and then fully recovered without medical intervention consistent with a viral illness like XXXX. 
Looking back, I feel that the care I received was not only unnecessary for my actual condition, but also left me deeply concerned about how quickly major interventions were being discussed. Had I followed through with what was suggested such as XXXX XXXX XXXX it would have permanently altered my lifestyle and health based on a conclusion that I now believe was reached too quickly and without properly considering my symptoms or travel history. He even remarked that he felt I seemed skeptical of him, and made a comment about the steak I had eaten for dinner which felt like an unfair assumption about my dietary habits being a root cause, rather than a thorough investigation of the full picture. 
For all of these reasons, I respectfully request that all charges from this visit be waived. I appreciate your time and consideration of my experience."

XXXX I received a statement from Flagstar bank noting that my XXXX payment had not been received. I contacted XXXX to inquire. I was told by XXXX that Flagstar bank rejected my payment on XX/XX/XXXX noting an invalid customer ID. We verified the account # with the account # on the Flagstar statement. The account numbers matched. The XXXX agent additionally noted that the money was being refunded to me. I checked my XXXX account and it showed a "" pending '' refund from Flagstar on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of my mortgage payment. 
- I contacted Flagstar to ask "" why '' and was told that there was no sign of a payment in their system. I informed the agent about the information regarding the ACH payment provided by XXXX. I was told that I could make the payment now. I told the agent that I would like to pay and would like the account to reflect receipt of payment on XXXX and interest adjusted accordingly. I was told "" Flagstar does not owe me anything ''. The agent reminded me that this would not reflect on my credit score but there was no solution to the fact that interest was now being charged on principal that I had paid on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not have access to my money between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The amount did not clear "" pending '' status until XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX Once the refund from Flagstar cleared my account I made my XXXX payment. 

As a consumer, I am not at fault for Flagstars inability to have the accounts they purchased ready for payment receipt by the due date of the payment. They knew they were the new service provider on, at a minimum, XX/XX/XXXX. The accounts should have been created and ready for payment receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. The account information was given to me in the XX/XX/XXXX notice from XXXX XXXX. Therefore, the account was clearly created, yet on XX/XX/XXXX my payment was rejected as "" invalid customer id '' In this situation, I did not have constructive receipt of my money between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( day it showed "" not pending '' ) I am one of millions of Americans whose mortgages are sold every year.

"Credit reporting, repair, or other","XXXX XXXX was the original account holder for a fraudulent account that was opened in my name. The account was turned over to XXXX XXXX for collection. I have an account with XXXX XXXX listed on my Equifax and XXXX Credit Reports in the amount of {$1300.00}. Both credit bureaus have refused to remove the account from my credit reports. I have disputed these items and will continue to dispute this item until they are removed from my credit reports. 

I contacted both credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX and disputed these items yet again and while both credit bureaus have complied with filing the dispute they informed me that they have verified that this is my account and the information is accurate. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they referred me to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  as it pertains to this account. I did contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX by phone and they were closed. I also sent them an email as well on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a letter from XXXX XXXX  Fraud Dept. dated XX/XX/XXXX that the company verified that this is not my account and that this account was indeed a fraudulent account that was opened in my name. 

I do not understand how I can have a valid letter from the company and yet this item still remains on my credit reports even though the company has verified that the account does not belong to me and was a fraudulent account. XXXX XXXX informed that they sent electronic letters to both Equifax and XXXX  telling them to remove this item from my credit reports ASAP and yet it remains. 

XX/XX/XXXX will be two months and according to the letter I received from XXXX XXXX it can take up to 30 days or 4-6 weeks. Well as of XX/XX/XXXX it will be 4-6 weeks and this item has not been removed from my credit  reports as of yet. The letter sent to me by XXXX XXXX was dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Also on my Equifax and XXXX Credit Reports they have accounts listed as closed/removed with a {$0.00} balance that is counting against me making my score go down and not up. When items have been verified that they do not belong to an individual and removed from your credit reports your scores goes up not down. Both reports are reporting the same information twice one with the amount and one with a {$0.00} balance so I am confused which one is it? 

Equifax has been the absolute worse of all and they told me that as a consumer I can not dispute any information on my credit report and that they can not delete or remove anything from my Equifax credit report only the company can. Equifax has been giving me the wrong information and every time I call in their is always a problem or I get a person who is a foreigner and does not speak English or their systems are always down. It is never ending and I am sick of it."
"Credit reporting, repair, or other","I keep all of my credit frozen. TransUnion had and still has an error on it's website that prevents the freezing process. 
In XX/XX/2022 I had my HVAC  replaced and I did get a home improvement loan with XXXX. 
Afterward I was able to refreeze my credit with all the bureaus except TransUnion. 
Due to this the following fraud happened : The HVAC  went fine and it was explained that the loan would not occur until after installation, which is exactly how things happened. It was installed, XXXX  called to verify installation and I received the loan documents to sign. 
A week later a sales representative from XXXX XXXX came to my home. 
I decided to pursue this for the betterment of my future and the Earth 's wellbeing as well. 
The salesperson got on my WiFi, he got on my XXXX to check my electric bill history. He explained the loan would be the same bill for the life of the loan and electric would only continue to increase. 
He said the loan would not start or be signed for until after installation, which was my current experience with my recent HVAC installation. 
I had no reason not to believe him. 
I thought my credit was frozen anyway. 
So, I answered questions, there's an amount of trust that goes with allowing a person into your home and to make structural changes there. 
I had no reason to believe this person was going to do things against my consent and to defraud me. 
Afterwards, the installation never occurred fully. 
I told the finance company who called, XXXX XXXX, that the installation was not completed. 
They paid anyway ( you can read more about this in my complaints on XXXX XXXX ) to which I immediately began reaching out in writing to them to dispute this. 
At this point I realized something was wrong with my credit freeze.

I checked and the only one open was TransUnion. 
I contacted them via XXXX because their website had serious issues and the contact form did not even work. 
Their response was non existent. 
I contacted them three more times, in addition sending handwritten letters and documents proving that this loan was not ever accepted nor agreed upon by myself. I explained the TILA violations and the fact that I never signed for anything with this company.

On the same day, I called my mortgage servicer, and they confirmed my account still showed as paid and current. I immediately made a replacement payment from the correct account. BSI, was not notified of returned payment until after XX/XX/year>. 

Even though the XXXX payment was resolved immediately and the XXXX payment is current, the servicer reported the account as 30 days late on XX/XX/year>, and has not since updated it to reflect current and now it reflects a 60-day delinquency. They backdated it to only reflect my last payment in XXXX. 

My credit report is now incorrectly showing that no mortgage payments have been made since XX/XX/year>, even though both XXXX and XXXX were paid and the account is current. 

Prior to this false report, I had a perfect 100 % payment history and had never been reported 30 days late on any accountincluding this mortgage."

Please accept this letter of representation regarding our client XXXX. 

The XXXX is reaching out to your office in an attempt to resolve a wrongful foreclosure action against my, XXXX. XXXX has a reverse mortgage with Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ). 

As part of scheduled repairs, my client initiated and completed repairs on her home. My client provided all of the required documents which confirmed that all repairs had been completed. Unfortunately, our review confirmed that RMS negligently failed to act reasonably to postpone and or cancel a pending foreclosure action on my client 's property. Subsequently, my client 's home was sold at trustee sale to a third party ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ). 

Following the sale, RMS representatives acknowledged their error, and provided assurance that the issue would be resolved. My client was served with an Unlawful Detainer action, continually harassed to vacate or surrender her property, and threatened with legal action by the new owner. RMS has failed to resolve this issue in a timely manner, and has failed to respond to numerous requests for information. 

A review of my client 's records confirmed that my client initiated required repairs to her property in compliance with the Promissory Note and Deed of Trust executed at the time her loan was originated. 

Please note, my client is elderly and has limited mobility. This factor caused a delay in initiating repairs to the property. Further, the required repairs were limited to minor replacement of carpet in two rooms. Also, my client was in constant contact with the lender during this entire process and provided necessary updates to the lender, as the repairs were being ordered and completed. 

On or before XX/XX/XXXX my client provided RMS a work invoice from XXXX. XXXX, which confirmed the completion on the required repairs at the property referenced above. On XX/XX/XXXX, my client spoke with XXXX, a representative at RMS which dealt with this repair issue. On this date XXXX confirmed that she would be postponing and or cancelling the pending foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my client faxed RMS proof of completion from XXXX. XXXX. My client followed up with a telephone conversation, again, with XXXX, who again assured her that the foreclosure sale date was in the process of being cancelled or postponed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, inspectors from RMS completed their physical review of the property and repairs and confirmed that all work had been completed on the property. On this same day, my client spoke with a RMS representative to confirm the inspection was complete and confirm that the foreclosure sale had been cancelled. The RMS representative assured my client that no foreclosure action would be completed. On the following day, my client once again spoke with RMS and was reassured that no sale would be completed.

The first payment was on XX/XX/XXXX. So, at the end of XXXX, I set up an account with them, made the first payment and set up autopay. I got a confirmation that autopay was set up successfully and went on a work trip to XXXX. 

I noticed no payment was taken from my account in XXXX. I tried logging in to make it manually, but it requires a phone confirmation, and I can not receive it from XXXX. 

I tried contacting them by email to ask to help apply the payment method manually. The support email given in their welcome message doesn't work ( got the no-reply message ). I tried emailing all other addresses they have, none of them work. 

Therefore, despite having funds, I can not make a payment. At best I will have to pay late fees when I come back, at worst my credit score will be ruined, which will cost me endless business losses. 

I understand I am "" at fault '' for traveling overseas, but every single autopay I set up before since moving to America worked properly. And I think a mortgage service company should have a way of getting reached out to via email, it's absurd that they don't. 

I went a step further and realized there are endless Internet complaints about them not picking up the phone, not applying payments properly, etc. 

All I want is to be able to make my payment. I have the funds to do so, I never missed any payments in my life. I want them to have a customer support email address. 

Thank you so much for helping with this and I apologize if it wasn't right to reach out to you with this."

Mortgage,"I was denied a home loan by Wells Fargo after submitting multiple consumer credit/loan applications with branch employees in XXXX XXXX, NV in XX/XX/XXXX. I have received emails from the institution for years warning me of various account changes despite my not having any accounts that I know of with them. I received emails stating my account was opened, changed, debited ( overdrawn ), or somehow accessed ever since submitting those applications for loan products ( mortgage/home loans ). These emails looked very legit and came as regularly as any open account would receive notice from the bank. I reviewed them for phishing and while they looked legit, I knew I did not open any accounts on the few occasions I entered the bank 's branches and submitted apps or inquired about products even though each visit required I provide the bank 's staff with my personal information including copies of identification. I believe the fake account has created a negative impact on my credit score, ability to obtain credit, and ability to obtain fair lending as over the years I have seen various transactions on my credit reports that refer to Wells Fargo but I assumed were errors. There were home loans in excess XXXX , auto loans for thousands and collections charges for accounts that were closed with Wells Fargo connected to them. I disputed the reports informally but with time restrictions on how long items sit on credit reports, some of those charges have automatically been removed from my credit report. 

I learned of the fraudulent accounts created in XX/XX/XXXX and am aware that some citizens hurt by this scam at Wells Fargo may have never even actually owned an account. Some may have been victimized in the ways in which I was victimized by taking my identity and opening the accounts after refusing me service/products at the counter. Initially, I believed it was a matter of discrimination based on race/gender/ethnicity and I still believe those things may have played a factor in my denied loan applications and resulted in the fraudulent account assigned to my name that resulted in email notifications about the account activities and credit reporting."
